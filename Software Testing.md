# **Fundamentals of Software Testing**

## **Importance of Software Testing**

- Ensures that the software is **error-free**.
    
- Verifies if the software meets **customer requirements**.
    
- Maintains **quality assurance**.
    
- **Saves costs** by detecting defects early.
    
- Builds **user trust** in the software.
    

## **Key Principles of Software Testing**

- Software must meet **specified requirements**.
    
- It should function **correctly without errors**.
    
- Ensures **reliability, performance, and security**.
    

## **Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)**

1. **Requirement Analysis** – Understanding testing requirements.
    
2. **Test Planning** – Defining test strategy, scope, and schedule.
    
3. **Test Case Development** – Writing test cases and scripts.
    
4. **Test Environment Setup** – Preparing necessary hardware/software.
    
5. **Test Execution** – Running test cases and reporting defects.
    
6. **Test Closure** – Evaluating test results and preparing reports.
    

## **Types of Software Testing**

### **1. Functional Testing**

- Ensures that the software behaves as expected based on requirements.
    
- Types:
    
    - **Unit Testing** – Testing individual modules.
        
    - **Integration Testing** – Checking how components work together.
        
    - **System Testing** – End-to-end testing of the whole system.
        
    - **Acceptance Testing** – Final validation by users, including:
        
        - **Alpha Testing (α)** – Conducted by in-house testers before release.
            
        - **Beta Testing (β)** – Conducted by end-users after release.
            

### **2. Non-Functional Testing**

- Focuses on performance, security, and user experience.
    
- Types:
    
    - **Performance Testing** – Checks speed, stability, and scalability.
        
    - **Security Testing** – Identifies vulnerabilities and threats.
        
    - **Usability Testing** – Ensures user-friendliness.
        
    - **Compatibility Testing** – Tests software across different devices and environments.

### **Types of Software Testing Based on Access to Code**

1. **Black Box Testing**
    
    - Tester **does not** have access to the internal code.
        
    - Focuses on **functional behavior** of the software.
        
    - Used for **system and acceptance testing**.
        
    - **Example:** Testing a login form by entering valid and invalid credentials.
        
2. **White Box Testing**
    
    - Tester **has full access** to the internal code.
        
    - Focuses on **code structure, logic, and flow**.
        
    - Used for **unit and integration testing**.
        
    - **Example:** Checking if all functions in a program are executed correctly.
        
3. **Grey Box Testing**
    
    - Tester has **partial knowledge** of the internal code.
        
    - Combines aspects of both black-box and white-box testing.
        
    - Helps find **security flaws and integration issues**.
        
    - **Example:** Testing an API where the tester knows the data flow but not the full implementation.
