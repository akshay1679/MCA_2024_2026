**Memory spooling** refers to the process of temporarily storing data or instructions in a buffer, or spool, in memory before they are processed. Spooling stands for **Simultaneous Peripheral Operations On-Line** and is commonly used to manage the flow of data between different devices or processes, especially when the speed of the data source and the destination differ.

For example:

- In printing, a document is first spooled (saved) in memory or on disk, allowing the application to finish quickly. The printer can then slowly process the spooled data at its own pace.

In essence, memory spooling helps coordinate and manage jobs that need to wait for slower resources or devices to become available, improving overall system efficiency.
