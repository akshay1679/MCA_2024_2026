### Data Source

- The actual source of data is database ,data warehouse, www, text files and other documents.
- Organizations typically store data in database or data warehouse.
- **Flat Files** --> Data files in text structure that can be easily extracted by data mining algorithms.
eg: CSV files

1. Relational  --> Collection of data organized in table with rows and columns
2. Data Warehouse --> Collection of data migrated from multiple sources that will queries and decision making.
3. Transactional --> It is a collection of data organised by time stamps data etc: to represent transaction in database.
4. Multi media --> audio,video,image, text and media. 

### Data Mining process(cleaning migration and selection)

* before passing the data to database (or) data ware house server,the data must be cleaned ,integrated and selected.
* **Data cleaning** 
	* As the information comes from various sources and in different format it cant be used directly for the data mining procedure because the data may not be completely & accurate
* **Data integration** 
	* It refers to the process of combining data from multiple sources into a single unified view
* **Database or Data warehouse server** 
	* it consists of original data that is ready to be processed 
	* Hence the server is the cause of referring the relevant data that is based on data mining as per user request
* **Data Mining Engine**
	* Data Mining Engine is a major component of any data mining system
	* It consists of several modules for operating data mining tasks,module association,classification, clustering, prediction, time-series analysis etc
	* It comprises of instruments and software used for obtaining insights and knowledge from data collected from various data sources an stored within the data warehouse
* **Pattern Evaluation Module** 
	* The pattern evaluation module is primary responsibility for the measure of investigation of the pattern by using a threshold value.
	* It collaborates with the data mining engine to focus the search on exciting patterns.
	* The pattern evaluation modules might be coordinated with the mining modules ,depending on the implementation of the   data mining techniques used.

* **Data Warehouse**
	* collection of database


**Spatial Database**
- Stores geographical information
- Stores data in the form of coordinate, Topology, Polygon, lines etc:
**Data processes**
- Removes of unwanted observations
- Fixes structural error
- Managing unwanted ==auther==
