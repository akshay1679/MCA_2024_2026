### âœ… 1. **What is a Network?**

A **network** is simply **two or more devices connected together** to share data and resources (like files, internet, printers, etc).

#### Types of Networks:

| Type    | Full Form                 | Use                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **LAN** | Local Area Network        | Home, office, school                |
| **WAN** | Wide Area Network         | Internet                            |
| **PAN** | Personal Area Network     | Bluetooth devices                   |
| **MAN** | Metropolitan Area Network | City-wide coverage (e.g., cable TV) |

### âœ… 2. **Common Networking Devices**

| Device           | Purpose                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Router**       | Connects different networks; routes data |
| **Switch**       | Connects devices within a network        |
| **Modem**        | Connects you to the internet (via ISP)   |
| **Access Point** | Provides Wi-Fi in a network              |
| **Firewall**     | Protects against unauthorized access     |

---

### âœ… 3. **IP Address**

- Every device on a network has a unique **IP address** (like a phone number for devices).
    
- **IPv4**: `192.168.1.1` (most common)
    
- **IPv6**: Longer format like `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`
    

#### Private IP Ranges (used in LAN):

- `192.168.0.0 â€“ 192.168.255.255`
    
- `10.0.0.0 â€“ 10.255.255.255`
    
- `172.16.0.0 â€“ 172.31.255.255`
    

---

### âœ… 4. **MAC Address**

- A **MAC address** is a unique ID assigned to every network interface.
    
- Format: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`
    

---

### âœ… 5. **OSI Model (7 Layers of Networking)**

A model to understand how data flows in a network.

| Layer | Name         | Example                 |
| ----- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| 7     | Application  | HTTP, FTP, DNS          |
| 6     | Presentation | Encryption/Decryption   |
| 5     | Session      | Maintaining sessions    |
| 4     | Transport    | TCP, UDP                |
| 3     | Network      | IP address, Routing     |
| 2     | Data Link    | MAC address, Switching  |
| 1     | Physical     | Cables, Wi-Fi, Ethernet |

---

### âœ… 6. **Common Protocols**

| Protocol       | Use                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **HTTP/HTTPS** | Web browsing                             |
| **DNS**        | Domain name resolution (google.com â†’ IP) |
| **DHCP**       | Assigns IP automatically                 |
| **FTP**        | File transfer                            |
| **TCP/UDP**    | Data transfer methods                    |
| **ICMP**       | Used by ping commands                    |
