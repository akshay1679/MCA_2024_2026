Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) are a type of deep neural network composed of multiple layers of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). They are designed to learn hierarchical representations of data, making them useful for unsupervised feature learning and dimensionality reduction, followed by supervised learning for tasks like classification.

1. Purpose

Unsupervised Pre-training:
DBNs use unsupervised learning to initialize weights. This helps avoid poor local minima and improves performance, especially when labeled data is limited.

Supervised Fine-tuning:
After pre-training, the whole network is fine-tuned using labeled data via backpropagation.
