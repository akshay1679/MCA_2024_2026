### Why Normalize?

Pixel values in images typically range from 0 to 255, representing the intensity of each color channel. Neural networks often perform better when the input data is scaled to a smaller range, such as 0 to 1.

**Benefits of Normalization:**

1. **Improved Training Speed:** Normalization helps the neural network converge faster during training, meaning it can learn the patterns in the data more quickly.
2. **Preventing Domination:** It prevents features with larger values from dominating the learning process, ensuring that all features contribute equally.
3. **Avoiding Exploding/Vanishing Gradients:** Helps in stabilizing the training process by preventing extremely large or small gradients, which can hinder learning.

In this specific case, dividing by 255.0 scales all pixel values to a range between 0 and 1, which is a common practice in image processing for deep learning.


## Normalizing Colored Images

Colored images typically have three color channels: red, green, and blue (RGB). Each pixel is represented by three values, one for each channel, also ranging from 0 to 255.

There are a couple of approaches you can take to normalize colored images:

### 1. Normalize Each Channel Independently

Similar to grayscale images, you can normalize each color channel separately by dividing its pixel values by 255.0. This ensures that each color channel's values fall within the range of 0 to 1.

library_add

content_copy

```
x_train = x_train / 255.0x_test = x_test / 255.0
```



This method is straightforward and often works well in practice. Since the code divides each element of the multi-dimensional array (representing the image) by 255, it implicitly applies the normalization to all color channels.

### 2. Using Mean and Standard Deviation

A more advanced approach is to normalize each color channel based on its mean and standard deviation. This involves calculating the mean and standard deviation of each channel across the entire dataset and then applying the following formula:

library_add

content_copy

```
normalized_pixel = (pixel_value - channel_mean) / channel_standard_deviation
```



This approach ensures that each color channel has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which can further improve the performance of your model. This is often referred to as standardization.

**Steps for Mean-Standard Deviation Normalization:**

1. **Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation:** Determine the mean and standard deviation for each color channel (R, G, B) across all images in your training dataset.
2. **Apply Normalization:** Subtract the corresponding channel mean from each pixel value and divide by the channel's standard deviation. You'll repeat this process for all pixels and all three channels in your training and testing datasets.
