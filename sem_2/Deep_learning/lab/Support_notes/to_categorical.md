## to_categorical: Converting Labels to One-Hot Encoding

The `to_categorical` function is a utility function provided by Keras (a deep learning library) that converts integer-encoded class labels into a one-hot encoded format. This is a common preprocessing step for multi-class classification problems where the target variable represents multiple categories.

**Why is one-hot encoding necessary?**

- **Categorical nature of labels:** In multi-class classification, the target variable represents different categories (e.g., digits 0-9, object classes). These categories are often represented as integers (e.g., 0 for digit '0', 1 for digit '1', etc.).
- **Avoiding ordinal relationships:** Using integers directly as labels can mislead the model into assuming an ordinal relationship between the categories (e.g., that digit '1' is greater than digit '0').
- **One-hot encoding:** One-hot encoding addresses this issue by representing each category as a binary vector with a single '1' indicating the corresponding category and '0' for all other categories. This avoids implying any ordinal relationships and provides a suitable format for multi-class classification models.

**How does to_categorical work?**

1. **Input:** It takes an array-like object of integer-encoded class labels as input.
2. **Number of classes:** It requires the total number of classes (`num_classes`) as an argument. If not provided, it infers the number of classes from the maximum label value + 1.
3. **Output:** It returns a NumPy array representing the one-hot encoded labels, where each row corresponds to a sample and each column represents a category.

**Example:**

Let's say you have class labels [0, 2, 1, 0] representing four samples belonging to three classes (0, 1, 2). Applying `to_categorical` with `num_classes=3` would result in the following one-hot encoded representation:

library_add

content_copy

```
[[1, 0, 0],  # Sample 1, Class 0 
[0, 0, 1],  # Sample 2, Class 2 
[0, 1, 0],  # Sample 3, Class 1 
[1, 0, 0]]  # Sample 4, Class 0
```



**In the given code:**

library_add

content_copy

```
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical
```

The `to_categorical` function is imported and used to convert the MNIST labels into one-hot encoded format:

library_add

content_copy

```
num_classes = 10y_train = to_categorical(y_train, num_classes)y_test = to_categorical(y_test, num_classes)
```

Here, the `y_train` and `y_test` arrays, containing the integer labels for the training and testing sets, are converted into one-hot encoded format using `to_categorical`. This prepares the labels for training the multi-class classification model for recognizing handwritten digits (0-9).

**In summary:**

The `to_categorical` function is a useful utility for converting integer-encoded class labels into a one-hot encoded representation, which is a suitable format for multi-class classification tasks. By using one-hot encoding, we avoid implying ordinal relationships between categories and provide a clear representation of the target variable for the model to learn from.
