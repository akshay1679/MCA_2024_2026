## Understanding the `Sequential` Model

In the context of building neural networks using Keras, the `Sequential` model provides a way to define a **linear stack of layers**. This means you're essentially creating a network where data flows sequentially through each layer, one after the other.

Here's a breakdown of the key reasons why `Sequential` is chosen:

1. **Simplicity:** `Sequential` is the simplest way to build a neural network in Keras. It's straightforward to understand and use, especially for beginners. You define the layers one by one, and they are automatically connected in a sequential order. This makes it ideal for tasks where the network architecture is relatively straightforward, like in this case with the Iris dataset.
    
2. **Common Architecture:** Many neural networks, particularly for classification and regression problems, can be effectively represented as a sequence of layers. The Iris dataset classification task fits this pattern, making `Sequential` a natural choice.
    
3. **Ease of Modification:** You can easily add or remove layers in a `Sequential` model using methods like `add()`. This flexibility allows for quick experimentation with different network structures during the model development process.
    
4. **Widely Used:** `Sequential` is a popular choice for building neural networks in Keras due to its simplicity and effectiveness. It's well-documented and supported by the Keras community.
    

**In summary,** the `Sequential` model is used here because it provides a simple and effective way to build a neural network for the Iris dataset classification task. Its linear structure aligns well with the typical flow of data in such networks, making it a convenient and commonly used choice.
