## Flatten: Reshaping for Dense Layers

The `Flatten` layer is a crucial component in CNNs, serving as a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">bridge between the convolutional layers and the dense layers</mark>. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Its primary function is to convert the multi-dimensional output of the convolutional layers into a single-dimensional vector, which can then be fed as input to the dense layers</mark>.

**Why is this necessary?**

- **Convolutional layers output feature maps:** Convolutional layers extract features from the input image and produce a set of feature maps. These feature maps are multi-dimensional, typically having width, height, and depth (representing the number of filters).
- **Dense layers expect a 1D input:** Dense layers, also known as fully connected layers, require a 1D vector as input. Each neuron in a dense layer is connected to every element in the previous layer's output.
- **Flatten acts as a connector:** The `Flatten` layer takes the multi-dimensional feature maps and flattens them into a single long vector. This transformation allows the output of the convolutional layers to be compatible with the input requirements of the dense layers.

**How does it work?**

Imagine a stack of papers (feature maps) with writing on each page. `Flatten` takes these papers and lays them out end-to-end, creating one long strip of paper with all the writing in a sequential order. This strip represents the flattened output, which can then be read by the dense layers.

**In the given code:**

library_add

content_copy

```
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Flatten, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D
```

[Use code with caution](https://g.co/legal/generative-code)

The `Flatten` layer is imported and used within the CNN model definition:

library_add

content_copy

```
model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))model.add(Flatten())  # Flattens the output of the MaxPooling2D layermodel.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
```

[Use code with caution](https://g.co/legal/generative-code)

In this code, the `Flatten` layer is placed after the `MaxPooling2D` layer. It takes the output of the `MaxPooling2D` layer (which is a multi-dimensional feature map) and converts it into a 1D vector. This flattened vector is then passed as input to the subsequent `Dense` layer.
