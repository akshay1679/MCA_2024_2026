## The Role of `Dense` Layers

`Dense` layers, also known as <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">fully connected layers,</mark> are a fundamental building block in neural networks. They are called "dense" because **each neuron in a Dense layer is connected to every neuron in the previous layer**. This dense connectivity <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">allows the network to learn complex relationships between features</mark>.

Here's why `Dense` layers are employed in this particular code:

1. **Universality:** `Dense` layers are considered universal function approximators, meaning they can theoretically learn any continuous function given enough neurons and training data. This makes them a versatile choice for a wide range of tasks, including classification problems like the Iris dataset classification.
    
2. **Feature Extraction:** In this code, `Dense` layers are used to extract and learn meaningful features from the Iris dataset. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Each layer applies a transformation to the input data, creating new representations that capture the underlying patterns in the data. The stacking of multiple `Dense` layers allows the network to learn increasingly complex and abstract features.</mark>
    
3. **Classification:** <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The final `Dense` layer in the model has a 'softmax' activation function and the number of neurons corresponding to the number of output classes (3 for Iris species). This layer is responsible for producing the final classification output, predicting the probability of each Iris species for a given input</mark>.
    
4. **Simplicity and Effectiveness:** `Dense` layers are relatively simple to implement and computationally efficient, making them a popular choice for many neural network architectures. They have been proven effective in various machine learning tasks, including image recognition, natural language processing, and, in this case, Iris classification.
