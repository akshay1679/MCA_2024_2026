## Sequential

The Sequential model in TensorFlow Keras is best used when you have a simple, linear stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor. This means the flow of data through your network is strictly sequential: data goes in, passes through each layer in order, and produces an output.
Here's a breakdown of when Sequential is appropriate:
Good use cases:
 * Basic feedforward neural networks (FFNNs): For tasks like simple classification or regression problems where the network architecture is straightforward.
 * Simple convolutional neural networks (CNNs): If your CNN has a linear flow of convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
 * Simple recurrent neural networks (RNNs): For basic sequence modeling tasks where the network's structure is a simple chain of RNN layers.
 * Prototyping and experimentation: Sequential makes it very quick and easy to build and test simple models.
 * When you are a beginner: Sequential is a great way to start learning about neural networks.
When Sequential is NOT appropriate:
 * Models with multiple inputs or outputs: If your model has multiple input sources or produces multiple output predictions, you'll need the functional API.
 * Models with shared layers: If you need to reuse a layer across different parts of the network, the functional API is necessary.
 * Models with complex topologies: If your network has branches, merges, or skip connections (e.g., ResNet, Inception), you'll need the functional API.
 * Models with residual connections: These connections require adding the output of an earlier layer to a later layer, which cannot be expressed in a sequential model.
 * Directed Acyclic Graphs(DAGs): The functional API is used to create neural networks that resemble a DAG.
In essence:
 * If your neural network architecture is a straight line, use Sequential.
 * If your neural network architecture is more complex, use the functional API.

## Dense

Dense layers, also known as fully connected layers, are a fundamental building block in neural networks, and they serve several crucial purposes:
1. Learning Complex Patterns:
 * Full Connectivity:
   * In a dense layer, every neuron is connected to every neuron in the preceding layer. This allows the network to capture intricate relationships and dependencies within the data.
   * This "full connectivity" enables the network to learn very complex, non-linear patterns.
 * Feature Combination:
   * Dense layers excel at combining the features learned by earlier layers (such as convolutional layers in CNNs) into higher-level representations.
   * This is especially important in the final stages of a neural network, where the network needs to make a final decision or prediction based on the learned features.
2. Function Approximation:
 * Universal Approximation Theorem:
   * Neural networks with dense layers can approximate any continuous function, given enough neurons. This makes them highly versatile for a wide range of tasks.
 * Regression and Classification:
   * Dense layers are used for both regression (predicting continuous values) and classification (predicting categories).
   * By adjusting the weights of the connections between neurons, the network can learn to map input data to the desired output.
3. Decision Making:
 * Final Layer:
   * Dense layers are often used as the final layer in a neural network, where they produce the output predictions.
   * In classification tasks, the final dense layer typically uses a softmax activation function to produce probabilities for each class.
Key Considerations:
 * Computational Cost:
   * Dense layers can be computationally expensive, especially with large input sizes, because of the high number of connections.
   * This can lead to increased training time and memory usage.
 * Overfitting:
   * Due to their high capacity, dense layers are prone to overfitting, especially when the training data is limited.
   * Techniques like dropout and regularization are often used to mitigate this.
In summary, dense layers are essential for learning complex patterns and making accurate predictions in neural networks. While they can be computationally demanding, their ability to capture intricate relationships makes them a valuable tool in deep learning.
