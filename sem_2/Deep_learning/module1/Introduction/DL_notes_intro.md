##  <u>Artificial intelligence?</u>

Artificial intelligence is the ability of a computer to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.
eg:
- mimicking the intelligence or behavior of human or any living entity

##  <u>Machine Learning?</u>

 A type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed
 
Machine learning is the study of algorithms that learn from examples and experience instead of relying on hard-coded rules and make predictions on new data.

 Machine Learning is the study of algorithms that - improve their ==performance==  - at some ==task==  - with ==experience== .

==[PTE]==

Model Training 
• Data partitioning 
• Training set 
• Test set

##  <u>Deep Learning?</u>

- Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning focusing on ==learning data representations as successive layers of increasingly meaningful representations==.

- Deep Learning ==uses artificial neural networks== to learn from lots of data without needing explicit programming.
• Capabilities: 
	1. • Handles ==large and complex datasets ==
	2. • Extracts ==meaningful patterns== and insights from diverse data 
	3. • Example: ==chemical structures==, biological information, and patient data (Drug Response Prediction)

Artificial Neural Networks ?

• Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are machine learning models that tries to mimic the complex functions of the human brain. 
• It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized into layers. 
• Information flows through these nodes, and the network adjusts the connection strengths (weights) during training to learn from data, enabling it to recognize patterns, make predictions, and solve various tasks in machine learning and artificial intelligence
