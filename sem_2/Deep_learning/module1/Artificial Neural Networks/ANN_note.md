#ANN

 For certain types of problems, such as ==learning to interpret== complex real-world data, artificial neural networks are among the most effective learning methods currently known.

eg:
 • Speech recognition 
 • Face recognition

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are machine learning models that tries to mimic the complex functions of the human brain. 
• It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized into layers. 
• Information flows through these nodes, and the network adjusts the connection strengths (weights) during training to learn from data, enabling it to recognize patterns, make predictions, and solve various tasks in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
