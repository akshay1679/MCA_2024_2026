 For certain types of problems, such as learning to interpret complex real-world data, artificial neural networks are among the most effective learning methods currently known.

forword propogation -->
back  propogation  <--  by chain rule(partial diff)

mse shows the error

back prop starts from MSE and end at weight

bios --> thrushold value 

line to categorical value is done by activation funtion

z - weighted sum
input layer no of nodes represent no ot features
output layer no of nodes represent no classes in label (if student yes or no)

forword starts from input and ends at output
back starts from MSE and ends at weight/bias
