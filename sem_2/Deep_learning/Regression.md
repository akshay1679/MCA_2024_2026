- Trying to fit a line to a set of data-points
- distance between data-points and line is called ==error==
- Best fit line will be one with less error
- in ml weare trying to find the equation of a line ==y = mx + c==
- in the case of regression we are trying to find the best fit lines to set of data-points
- 
in Y = MX +C 

Y ==> Dependent variable
mx ==> independent variable

if there are more than one varible we are trying to find the equation of a ==Hyperplane==


## <u>Residual</u>

Difference between actual and predicted value
the best model is estimated by minimising the sum of squares of the residuals

==cost function==  used to mesure the error of the model
