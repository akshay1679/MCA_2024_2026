Security Concepts: CIA Triad, Authenticity, and Non-repudiation

Security in networking and information systems revolves around core principles that help ensure data protection and integrity. The CIA Triad and additional concepts like Authenticity and Non-repudiation form the foundation of cybersecurity.

1. CIA Triad (==Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability==)

The CIA Triad is a fundamental security model that defines the key objectives of information security. Each component ensures a specific aspect of protection.

1.1 Confidentiality

Ensures that information is accessible ==only to authorized individuals,== preventing unauthorized access.

==Protects sensitive data== from being exposed to unauthorized users.

Implemented using ==encryption, access control mechanisms, authentication protocols, and data maskin==g.

Example: A banking system encrypts customer account details so that only authorized employees and customers can access them.


1.2 Integrity

Ensures that data remains ==accurate, consistent, and unaltered during transmission or storage.==

==Prevents unauthorized modification, deletion, or corruption of data.==

Implemented ==using hashing algorithms (==e.g., SHA-256, MD5), ==checksums, digital signatures==, and data validation mechanisms.

Example: A software update file is signed with a cryptographic hash so users can verify that it has not been tampered with.


1.3 Availability

==Ensures that information and systems are accessible when needed by authorized users.==

Protects against downtime due to cyber-attacks, hardware failures, or system malfunctions.

Implemented using ==redundancy, failover mechanisms, backup systems, load balancing, and protection against== denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

Example: A cloud storage service maintains multiple redundant servers so users can always access their data, even if one server fails.



---

2. Authenticity

Refers to ==verifying that users==, devices, or data sources are genuine and trustworthy.

==Ensures that an entity (user, system, or process) is who they claim to be.==

==Prevents identity spoofing, fraud, or unauthorized access==.

Implemented using ==authentication== mechanisms such as usernames and passwords, multi-factor authentication ==(MFA)==, digital certificates, and biometrics.

Example: When logging into an online banking system, a user is required to enter a password and a one-time password (OTP) sent to their registered mobile number.



---

3. Non-repudiation

==Ensures that an entity (user or system) cannot deny their actions or transactions.==

==Provides proof of the origin and integrity of data exchanges, preventing disputes.==

Implemented using digital signatures, audit logs, and blockchain technology.

Example: In an e-commerce transaction, a digital signature is attached to an electronic contract so that neither the buyer nor the seller can deny signing it.

Conclusion

The CIA Triad, along with Authenticity and Non-repudiation, forms the backbone of security in networking and information systems. Implementing these principles helps organizations protect their data, maintain trust, and ensure compliance with security standards.

---

1. Confidentiality Attacks
These attacks focus on unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Eavesdropping / Sniffing

Definition: Attacker secretly listens to network traffic.

Example: Capturing unencrypted data over public Wi-Fi.


Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)

Definition: Attacker intercepts communication between two parties.

Example: Intercepting login credentials during an HTTP login.


Traffic Analysis

Definition: Attacker observes communication patterns, even if data is encrypted.

Example: Noticing when users access a VPN and deducing habits.




---

2. Integrity Attacks
These target the trustworthiness and accuracy of data.

Data Tampering

Definition: Unauthorized modification of data in transit or storage.

Example: Changing account numbers in an intercepted fund transfer request.


Hash Collision Attacks

Definition: Two different inputs produce the same hash value.

Example: Using a forged document with the same MD5 hash as the original.


Replay Attacks

Definition: Reusing a previously captured valid message.

Example: Re-sending a login token to access a session.




---

3. Availability Attacks
These aim to disrupt or deny access to services or systems.

Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed DoS (DDoS)

Definition: Flooding a server with requests to make it unavailable.

Example: Sending millions of packets to a web server until it crashes.


Ransomware

Definition: Malware that encrypts data and demands payment to unlock it.

Example: WannaCry ransomware that affected healthcare systems.


Resource Exhaustion

Definition: Consuming all system resources (CPU, RAM, storage).

Example: Uploading large files repeatedly to fill up disk space.




---

4. Authenticity Attacks
These focus on deceiving systems or users about identity or origin.

Phishing

Definition: Trick users into revealing credentials via fake sites or emails.

Example: Fake email that looks like itâ€™s from your bank.


Credential Stuffing

Definition: Using leaked username-password pairs from other breaches.

Example: Reusing LinkedIn breach passwords to log into Gmail.


Spoofing

Definition: Pretending to be someone/something else (e.g., IP, MAC, domain).

Example: DNS spoofing redirects users to a fake website.




---

5. Non-Repudiation Attacks
These involve denying or faking involvement in an action or communication.

Forged Digital Signatures

Definition: Using stolen or fake keys to sign data.

Example: Signing an email to make it look like it came from the CEO.


Denial of Transaction

Definition: A user falsely claims they didnâ€™t perform an action.

Example: Claiming they didnâ€™t approve a money transfer.


Session Hijacking

Definition: Attacker takes control of an active session.

Example: Stealing a session cookie to impersonate a user.
