🔹 Understanding the Relationship

🔹 Vulnerability – A weakness in a system that can be exploited.
🔹 Threat – A potential danger that could exploit a vulnerability.
🔹 Attack – A malicious action that exploits a vulnerability to cause harm.

🔗 How They Work Together?

A threat actor (hacker) exploits a vulnerability to launch an attack.

📌 Example:

Vulnerability: Weak password (e.g., "123456")

Threat: A hacker trying to crack passwords

Attack: A Brute-force attack to guess the weak password

Authentication vs. Authorization

🔹 Authentication (AuthN) vs Authorization (AuthZ):

📌 Analogy:

Authentication = "Who are you?" (Passport check at airport)

Authorization = "What are you allowed to do?" (Boarding pass check for Business Class)

Mechanisms for Authentication & Authorization

✅ Authentication Mechanisms

1️⃣ Password-Based Authentication (Traditional but weak)
2️⃣ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (E.g., OTP, biometrics)
3️⃣ Biometric Authentication (Fingerprint, Face ID, Retina scan)
4️⃣ Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) (Certificates, Digital Signatures)
5️⃣ OAuth, OpenID Connect (OIDC) (Used in SSO like Google/Facebook login)

✅ Authorization Mechanisms

1️⃣ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (User roles: Admin, User, Guest)
2️⃣ Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) (Access based on conditions like time, location, device)
3️⃣ JSON Web Tokens (JWT) (Used in API security)
4️⃣ OAuth 2.0 (For third-party access control, e.g., "Sign in with Google")

🔹 Summary

1️⃣ Vulnerabilities are weaknesses, threats exploit vulnerabilities, and attacks use threats to cause harm.
2️⃣ Authentication (AuthN) confirms identity, while Authorization (AuthZ) controls access.
3️⃣ Attacks on Authentication involve password theft, phishing, brute-force attacks.
4️⃣ Attacks on Authorization involve privilege escalation, broken access control, and IDOR.
