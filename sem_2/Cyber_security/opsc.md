What are the 5 steps in OPSEC?
In April 1990, not long after the White House issued NSDD-298, the Interagency OPSEC Support Staff published a monograph that provided background information about OPSEC and discussed the provisions of the NSDD, which formalized the OPSEC program. The monograph described OPSEC as a five-step process: identification of critical information, analysis of threats, analysis of vulnerabilities, assessment of risks and application of countermeasures.

Today, many organizations follow the same process, using some variation of the following five steps to meet their specific requirements:

Identify critical information. The first step is to determine which critical information would cause the most harm if an adversary obtained it. This includes intellectual property, financial statements, credit card data, product research and personally identifiable information, which might come from employees, customers, clients, patients or other sources.
Analyze threats. The next step is to identify who is a threat to the organization's critical information. There might be numerous adversaries who target different information. For example, a company that sells software products should consider any competitors or hackers who might target its source code.
Analyze vulnerabilities. In this stage, the organization examines its operations and tries to identify potential vulnerabilities. The analysis not only includes the systems in place for protecting critical information, but also any operations, routines or behavior that could potentially compromise that information.
Assess risks. The next step is to determine the threat level associated with each of the identified vulnerabilities. The organization should rank the risks based on factors such as the likelihood of a specific type of attack or how damaging it would be to operations. Higher-risk events have a more pressing need for countermeasures.
Apply appropriate countermeasures. The last step involves planning and deploying countermeasures that will help mitigate the risks. The best place to start is with the risks that represent the biggest threat to operations. Potential security improvements might include hardware upgrades, increased training or a new information governance strategy
