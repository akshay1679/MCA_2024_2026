Cyberattacks can be categorized into Passive Attacks and Active Attacks based ==on their nature and impact.== These attacks target different security principles, such as Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad), as well as Authenticity and Non-repudiation.

1. Passive Attacks vs. Active Attacks

ðŸ”¹ Passive Attacks

==A passive attack is when someone secretly listens to or monitors data being transmitted over a network without altering it. The attackerâ€™s goal is to gather sensitive information, like passwords or personal details, without being detected.==

Example: A hacker intercepts ==WiFi signals to read emails== but does not change anything.



Goal: To gather sensitive information stealthily without being detected.

Impact: Primarily affects Confidentiality.

Examples:

Eavesdropping ==(Sniffing) â€“ Capturing network traffic (e.g., Wireshark,== MITM attacks).

Traffic Analysis â€“ Monitoring data patterns to infer sensitive information.

==Shoulder Surfing â€“ Observing someoneâ€™s screen or keyboard inputs.==

Passive Wiretapping â€“ Tapping into network cables to monitor communications.



ðŸ‘‰ Prevention Measures:
âœ… Encryption (SSL/TLS, AES, RSA) to prevent unauthorized access.
âœ… ==VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) for secure tunneling.==
âœ… ==Secure authentication (Multi-Factor Authentication - MFA).==
âœ… Anti-sniffing tools and network monitoring.

ðŸ”¹ Active Attacks

==Definition: Attacks where the attacker modifies, disrupts, or destroys data or system functionality==.

Goal: To manipulate, alter, or destroy information.

Impact: ==Primarily affects Integrity, Availability, Authenticity, and Non-repudiation.==

==IAAN==

Examples:

==Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) â€“ Intercepting and altering communications between two parties.==

==Denial of Service (DoS) & Distributed DoS (DDoS) â€“ Overloading a system to make it unavailable.==

==Session Hijacking â€“ Taking control of an active session.==

SQL Injection â€“ Injecting malicious SQL commands to manipulate a database.

Malware Attacks (Viruses, Worms, Ransomware, Trojans) â€“ Infecting systems to steal or damage data.

Phishing & Social Engineering â€“ Tricking users into revealing sensitive information.



ðŸ‘‰ Prevention Measures:
âœ… ==Firewalls== and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS/IPS).
âœ… ==Strong authentication== and session encryption.
âœ… Regular security updates and patch management.
âœ… Web application security (WAF, secure coding practices).
âœ… Employee awareness and phishing protection.

Conclusion

Both passive and active attacks pose serious threats to network security and data integrity. Implementing strong encryption, authentication mechanisms, firewalls, IDS/IPS, and employee training can help mitigate these risks.
