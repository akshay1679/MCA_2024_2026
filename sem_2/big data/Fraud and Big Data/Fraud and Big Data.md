Here are examples for each section from the PDF:

### **1. Fraud and Big Data**

#### Example:

- A bank analyzes customer transaction data for years to detect unusual spending patterns. If a person who usually spends â‚¹10,000 per month suddenly spends â‚¹1,00,000 in a day from a different location, the system flags it as potential fraud.

### **2. Elastic Search**

#### Example:

- An e-commerce platform like **Amazon** uses Elastic Search to analyze historical purchase data and detect fraud. If a user buys a high-value product using a new card and requests a refund immediately, Elastic Search can flag it as suspicious.

---

### **3. Social Network Analysis (SNA)**

#### Example:

- **Insurance fraud detection**: If multiple people file claims using similar accident details and share connections on social media, SNA can detect these links and flag the claims as potentially fraudulent.

---

### **4. Detecting and Preventing Fraud**

#### Example:

- **Credit Card Fraud**: If a personâ€™s card is used in two different countries within minutes, big data analytics can instantly detect this and block the card.
    
- **Online Banking Fraud**: If a hacker tries to log in from an unusual IP address, real-time processing can detect and prevent unauthorized access.

### **5. Credit Risk Management**

#### Example:

- **Loan approval process**: A bank like **HDFC** uses big data to analyze a personâ€™s past credit history before approving a loan. If a person has multiple unpaid loans, they are marked as a high-risk borrower.
