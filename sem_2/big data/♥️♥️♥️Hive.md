Hive Overview

Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure tool to process structured data.

It resides on top of Hadoop to summarize Big Data and makes querying and analyzing easy.

Features of Hive

Stores Schema in a db and proce data in HDFS ().

Dev for OLAP 

Use SQL-type lang for querying -> HiveQL or HQL.

It is familiar, fast, scalable, and extensible.

Architecture of Hive
==Dig==
1. User Interface (UI)

Interfaces: Hive Web UI, Hive Command Line, Hive HD.

Allows interaction between users and HDFS.



2. Meta Store

Uses db S to store schema or metadata and HDFS mapping.



3. HiveQL Process Engine

Uses HiveQL (similar to SQL) to query schema info from Metastore.

Replaces traditional MapReduce by allowing queries instead of Java programs.



4. Execution Engine

Connects HiveQL Process Engine with MapReduce.

Processes query and generates MapReduce-like results.



5. Data Storage

Uses HDFS or HBase for storing data.

Hive Query Processing Flow

Send Plan → Compiler checks requirements, resends plan to driver.

Execute Plan → Driver sends execute plan to Execution Engine.

Execute Job → Engine triggers MapReduce job via Job Tracker (NameNode) → assigned to Task Tracker (DataNode).

Metadata Operations → Engine interacts with Metastore as needed.

Fetch Results → Engine collects results from DataNodes.

Send Results → Engine sends results to Driver → Driver sends results to Hive Interfaces.

HiveQL Example (Select Where)

HiveQL (Hive Query Language) processes and analyzes structured data in Metastore.

Example Query:

hive> SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > 30000;
