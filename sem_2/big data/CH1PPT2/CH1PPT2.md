The PDF discusses **Big Data** and its different types, industry applications, and approaches to data management. Below is a breakdown with examples:

### **Types of Big Data**

1. **Structured Data**
    - Mean data that can be <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">processed, stored, and retrieved in a fixed format</mark>.
    - Highly organized information that can be readily and seamlessly stored and accessed from a database by simple search engine algorithms.
    - Example: A companyâ€™s employee database with names, job titles, and salaries.
2. **Unstructured Data**
    
    - <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Lacks a defined structure, making it harder to process</mark>.
    - Example: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Emails</mark>, social media posts, videos, and images.
3. **Semi-Structured Data**
    
    - Contains both structured and unstructured elements.
    - Example: **JSON files**, which have structured tags but flexible content.

### **Structured Data Example:**

- **Relational Databases** store data in rows and columns.
- Example: A customer database for an e-commerce store with fields like:
    
    |Customer ID|Name|Email|Purchase History|
    |---|---|---|---|

### **Industry Examples of Big Data**

- **Healthcare** â€“ Patient records and medical images.
- **Manufacturing** â€“ IoT sensor data from machines.
- **Banking** â€“ Fraud detection and transaction analysis.

### **Schema-on-Write vs. Schema-on-Read**

- **Schema-on-Write:** Define the structure **before storing** the data.
    - Example: Traditional databases where tables are predefined.
    - Structured data is typically stored using schema-on-write. This is because the schema is known in advance and can be used to optimize the storage and performance of the data.
- **Schema-on-Read:** Define the structure **when reading** the data.
    - Example: Analyzing social media posts where the format isn't fixed.
    - Unstructured data is typically stored using schema-onread. This is because the schema is not known in advance and may need to be changed frequently.
