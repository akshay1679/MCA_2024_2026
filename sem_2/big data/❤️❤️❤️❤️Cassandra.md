### **What is Apache Cassandra?**  
Apache Cassandra is a 
**highly scalable, distributed, and decentralized NoSQL database** no single point of failure.  dev fb

### **Key Features of Cassandra**  

#### **1. Decentralized Architecture**  
- **No Master-Slave Hierarchy**: All nodes are equal (peer-to-peer), eliminating bottlenecks.  
- **Ring Topology**: Nodes  arr in a log ring, and data is distributed using consistent hashing.  

#### **2. High Availability & Fault Tolerance**  
- **Replication**: 
- **No Single Point of Failure**: If one node fails, others take over seamlessly.  

#### **3. Linear Scalability**  
- **Horizontal Scaling**:  throughput with no downtime.  
- **Elasticity**: Lightly loaded nodes can shift positions to balance data distribution.  
#### **4. Column-Oriented Storage**  
- **Flexible Schema**:  columns can vary per row.  
- **Wide-Column Store**: grouped into column families.  

#### **5. Optimized for Write-Heavy Workloads**  
- **Append-Based Storage**: Writes   fast bic data is sequentially appn.  
- **No Read-Before-Write**:  doesn't need to read before writing.

### **How Cassandra Works**  

#### **1. Data Partitioning (Sharding)**  
- Each row has a **partition key**, which is # to determine its storage location in the ring.  
- Example: If `user_id` is the partition key, Cassandra hashes it and assigns it to a node.  

#### **2. Replication Strategy**  
- **Replication Factor (RF)**: Defines how many copies of data exist (e.g., RF=3 means 3 copies).  
- **Replication Strategies**:  
  - **SimpleStrategy** (for single datacenter).  
  - **NetworkTopologyStrategy** (for multi-datacenter setups).  

#### **3. Gossip Protocol (How Nodes Communicate)**  
- Nodes exchange state information (like heartbeats) in a decentralized way.  
- **Scuttleback Gossip**: A variant used in Cassandra for efficient failure detection.  

#### **4. Failure Detection & Recovery**  
- **Accrual Failure Detector**: Uses a suspicion value (`phi`) to predict node failures 
- **Hinted Handoff**: If a node is down, another node temporarily holds its writes and replays them later.  

#### **5. Query Language (CQL - Cassandra Query Language)**  
- Similar to SQL but optimized for Cassandra’s structure.  
- Example:  
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE users (user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, email TEXT);
  INSERT INTO users (user_id, name, email) VALUES (uuid(), 'Alice', 'alice@example.com');
  ```

### **Use Cases for Cassandra**  
✅ **Time-Series Data** (e.g., IoT sensor logs, stock market data).  
✅ **High-Write Applications** (e.g., messaging apps, social media feeds).  
✅ **Global Distributed Systems** (e.g., Netflix, Uber, Apple iCloud use Cassandra).  
✅ **Fraud Detection & Real-Time Analytics**.
