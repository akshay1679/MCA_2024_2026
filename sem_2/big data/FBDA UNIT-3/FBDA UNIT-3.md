The PDF document is about Hadoop and MapReduce programming, covering the fundamentals, architecture, configurations, and practical implementations. Here's a detailed breakdown:


---

1. Introduction to Hadoop and MapReduce

Hadoop is an open-source framework for processing and storing large datasets in a distributed manner. It helps in handling Big Data challenges through efficient parallel processing.

Hadoop Components:

HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) – Handles data storage across multiple machines.

MapReduce – A processing model for large-scale parallel computations.

YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) – Manages resources and job scheduling.

2. Differences Between Hadoop and RDBMS

3. Hadoop Features

Open Source – Free to use and modify.

Distributed Processing – Uses multiple nodes for faster processing.

Fault Tolerance – Data is replicated across multiple nodes.

Scalability – Can add or remove nodes easily.

High Availability – Data remains accessible even if a node fails.



---

4. Hadoop Architecture

Hadoop follows a Master-Slave architecture:

Master:

NameNode – Manages file system metadata.

ResourceManager – Allocates cluster resources.

JobTracker – Schedules and monitors jobs.


Slaves:

DataNode – Stores data blocks.

NodeManager – Manages resources on each node.

TaskTracker – Executes assigned tasks.




---

5. HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)

Stores large files across multiple nodes.

Replicates data for fault tolerance (default 3 copies).

Optimized for high-throughput data access.

Blocks are distributed across DataNodes.


HDFS Daemons:

NameNode – Tracks file locations.

DataNode – Stores actual data.

Secondary NameNode – Creates snapshots of metadata for backup.


HDFS Operations:

Commands for managing files and directories:

hdfs dfs -mkdir /chp → Create a directory.

hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal file.txt /chp/ → Copy a file to HDFS.

hdfs dfs -ls /chp → List contents.

hdfs dfs -rm /chp/file.txt → Remove a file.

6. MapReduce Programming

A two-phase parallel processing model:

Map Phase: Splits input data into key-value pairs.

Reduce Phase: Aggregates and processes intermediate results.


MapReduce Workflow:

1. Splits input data into independent chunks.


2. Mappers process each chunk and produce intermediate outputs.


3. Partitioners group the data by key.


4. Reducers aggregate the output to produce the final result.



MapReduce Phases:

1. Record Reader – Reads input and converts it into key-value pairs.


2. Mapper – Processes and generates intermediate data.


3. Combiner (optional) – Local aggregation before sending to reducers.


4. Partitioner – Divides intermediate keys among reducers.


5. Reducer – Processes and combines final results.

7. Hadoop Modes of Installation

8. Standalone Mode – Runs on a single machine (for debugging).


9. Pseudo-Distributed Mode – All daemons run on one machine.


10. Fully Distributed Mode – Used in production with multiple nodes.




---

8. YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)

ResourceManager (Global Manager)

Scheduler – Allocates resources to applications.

Application Manager – Manages job execution.


NodeManager – Runs on each machine to track tasks.

ApplicationMaster – Manages the execution of individual jobs.

9. MapReduce vs SQL

10. Hadoop Ecosystem

Additional tools that integrate with Hadoop:

HBase – NoSQL database for real-time processing.

Hive – SQL-like interface for querying Big Data.

Pig – Scripting language for large datasets.

Oozie – Workflow scheduler.

Zookeeper – Distributed coordination service.

Sqoop – Transfers data between Hadoop and RDBMS.

11. MapReduce Programs

Word Count Example

A simple MapReduce program in Java to count words in a file.

public static class WCMapper extends Mapper<Object, Text, Text, IntWritable> {
    private final static IntWritable one = new IntWritable(1);
    private Text word = new Text();
    
    public void map(Object key, Text value, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        StringTokenizer itr = new StringTokenizer(value.toString());
        while (itr.hasMoreTokens()) {
            word.set(itr.nextToken());
            context.write(word, one);
        }
    }
}

Mapper: Breaks text into words.

Reducer: Aggregates word counts.

Driver: Configures and runs the job.

12. Real-World Applications of MapReduce

Social Networks: Analyzing user behavior (e.g., Facebook, Twitter).

Healthcare: Genomic data analysis.

Finance: Fraud detection.

Retail: Customer segmentation.

Weather Forecasting: Predicting climate changes.

Stock Market: High-frequency trading analysis.

HDFS efficiently stores massive datasets.

MapReduce enables parallel computation.

YARN improves resource management.

The Hadoop ecosystem supports various Big Data applications.
