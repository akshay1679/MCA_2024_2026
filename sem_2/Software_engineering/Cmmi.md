CMMI Capability Levels Explained

The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a framework for improving and assessing the maturity of processes within an organization. Unlike the older CMM which focuses on organizational maturity levels, CMMI capability levels focus on individual process areas.

Each process area can be rated on a scale from Level 0 to Level 5, based on how well the process is implemented and managed.

CMMI Capability Levels


---

## Level 0: Incomplete

Definition: The ==process is not performed or only partially performed.==

Characteristics:

No goals are achieved.

No documentation or tracking.


Example: A team has no bug tracking process and fixes issues haphazardly without any record.



---

## Level 1: Performed

Definition: The ==process is executed and achieves its purpose==.

Characteristics:

Process is done, but not necessarily planned or documented.

Success depends on individuals.


Example: A developer tests the code before deployment, but thereâ€™s no standard test process or documentation.



---

## Level 2: Managed

Definition: ==The process is planned, executed, monitored, and controlled==.

Characteristics:

Follows policies and plans.

Resources and responsibilities are assigned.

Process is tracked and reviewed.


Example: Testing follows a written test plan, and defects are logged using a tool like JIRA.



---

Level 3: Defined

Definition: The ==process is well-documented, standardized, and integrated into organizational standards.==

Characteristics:

Tailored from organizational process assets.

Training is provided.


Example: Every project follows a company-wide SDLC model with templates for design, coding, and testing.



---

## Level 4: Quantitatively Managed

Definition: The process is controlled using quantitative data and performance metrics.

Characteristics:

Process performance is predictable.

Statistical tools and analysis are used.


Example: The team tracks defect density, cycle time, and uses control charts to manage process stability.



---

## Level 5: Optimizing

Definition: Focus is on continuous process improvement using innovation and feedback.

Characteristics:

Root cause analysis for defects.

New tools and practices are introduced regularly.


Example: An organization introduces AI-driven testing tools based on past analysis to reduce manual errors and improve speed.

Summary Table

Capability Level	Name	Key Features	Example

Level 0	Incomplete	Process not implemented or only partially done	No tracking of bugs
Level 1	Performed	Process achieves its purpose but is informal	Testing done but not documented
Level 2	Managed	Process is planned, tracked, and managed	Test plans and defect logs used
Level 3	Defined	Standardized and documented process	SDLC followed across all teams
Level 4	Quantitatively Managed	Uses metrics and statistical control	Defect trends tracked with data analysis
Level 5	Optimizing	Focus on innovation and continuous improvement	Using AI tools to improve QA
