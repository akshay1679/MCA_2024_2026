The Waterfall Model / Classic life cycle model is a traditional software development methodology that follows a ==linear and sequential approach.== It consists of distinct phases, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. The model is best suited for projects with clear requirements and minimal changes expected during development.

Phases of the Waterfall Model

1. ==Requirement Gathering & Analysis –== Collect and document all requirements.


2. ==System Design== – Plan architecture, data structures, and system components.


3. ==Implementation== (Coding) – Develop the software based on the design.


4. ==Testing== – Identify and fix defects in the software.


5. ==Deployment== – Release the software to users.


6. ==Maintenance== – Provide updates, bug fixes, and support.



**Advantages**

==Simple== and easy to understand.

==Well-structured== and documented process.

Best for projects with ==fixed requirements==.


**Disadvantages**

==No flexibility== for requirement changes.

==Testing is done late== in the process, increasing the risk of major issues.

==Not suitable for complex or long-term projects.==

• This model is not good for complex and object oriented projects. 

• The amount of risk is high

It is less popular today, as Agile and DevOps models offer more flexibility and faster iterations. However, it is still used in industries like aerospace and healthcare, where strict documentation and predictability are required.
