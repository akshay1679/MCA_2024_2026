The Prototype Development Model is a software development approach where a working prototype of the system is built, tested, and refined before the final product is developed. It is useful when requirements are not well understood, allowing users to provide feedback early in the development process.

## Phases of Prototype Development Model:

1. Requirement Gathering – Basic requirements are collected from stakeholders.


2. Quick Design – A rough design of the system is created.


3. Prototype Development – A basic working model (prototype) is built.


4. User Evaluation – Users review the prototype and provide feedback.


5. Refinement – The prototype is refined based on user feedback.


6. Final Product Development – Once the prototype is finalized, the actual system is developed.



## Advantages:

Helps clarify vague requirements.

Early user involvement improves customer satisfaction.

Reduces risk by identifying issues early.

Faster development for complex projects.


## Disadvantages:

Can increase development costs if too many iterations are needed.

Users might misunderstand the prototype as the final system.

Documentation may be neglected due to frequent changes.


## When to Use:

When exact requirements are unclear.

For UI/UX-heavy applications.

When innovative or complex systems are being developed.

## Example

 Scenario: Developing a Mobile Banking App Using the Prototype Model

Step 1: Requirement Gathering

A bank wants to develop a new mobile banking app but isn't sure what features customers need. The basic requirements collected include:

Viewing account balance

Transferring money

Paying bills


Step 2: Quick Design

A simple design is created with basic UI layouts for login, balance checking, and fund transfers.

Step 3: Prototype Development

A rough working version of the app is built with:

A login screen (but no full authentication)

A dummy account balance display

A basic money transfer interface (without real transactions)


Step 4: User Evaluation

The bank’s customers test the prototype and provide feedback:

They find the login process too complicated.

They want fingerprint authentication.

They request a feature to set transaction limits.


Step 5: Refinement

The prototype is improved based on feedback:

Fingerprint login is added.

A transaction limit feature is included.

The UI is simplified for better user experience.
