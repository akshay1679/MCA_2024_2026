The Waterfall Model / Classic life cycle model is a traditional software development methodology that follows a ==linear and sequential approach.== It consists of distinct phases, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. The model is best suited for projects with clear requirements and minimal changes expected during development.

Phases of the Waterfall Model

1. ==Requirement Gathering & Analysis –== Collect and document all requirements.


2. ==System Design== – Plan architecture, data structures, and system components.


3. ==Implementation== (Coding) – Develop the software based on the design.


4. ==Testing== – Identify and fix defects in the software.


5. ==Deployment== – Release the software to users.


6. ==Maintenance== – Provide updates, bug fixes, and support.



**Advantages**

==Simple== and easy to understand.

==Well-structured== and documented process.

Best for projects with ==fixed requirements==.


**Disadvantages**

==No flexibility== for requirement changes.

==Testing is done late== in the process, increasing the risk of major issues.

==Not suitable for complex or long-term projects.==

• This model is not good for complex and object oriented projects. 

• The amount of risk is high

It is less popular today, as Agile and DevOps models offer more flexibility and faster iterations. However, it is still used in industries like aerospace and healthcare, where strict documentation and predictability are required.

Waterfall Model

The Waterfall Model, also known as the Linear Sequential Model or Classic Life Cycle Model, follows a step-by-step approach in software development.

Key Features:

Each phase is fully completed before moving on to the next phase.

It is best suited for ==small projects== with ==well-defined requirements==.

==Feedback== is taken after each phase to ensure the project stays on the right path.

Testing begins only after development is fully completed.

### Advantages of the Waterfall Model

==Simple and Easy to Use== – The Waterfall model is straightforward, making it easy to understand, implement, and use.

==Clear Requirements== – Since all requirements are defined at the beginning, project management becomes easier.

==No Phase Overlap== – Each phase is completed before moving to the next, avoiding overlapping and confusion.

==Suitable for Small Projects== – Works well for projects where requirements are well understood.

==Focus on Quality== – Preferred for projects where quality is more important than cost.


---

### Disadvantages of the Waterfall Model

==Not Suitable for Complex and Object-Oriented Projects== – The rigid structure makes it difficult to adapt to complex or evolving requirements.

==Inefficient for Long Projects== – As the project duration increases, managing changes and modifications becomes challenging.

==Late Detection of Issues== – Problems remain undiscovered until the testing phase, making fixes costly and time-consuming.

==High Risk Factor== – Since all phases are completed sequentially, errors in early stages can lead to significant risks later in development.
