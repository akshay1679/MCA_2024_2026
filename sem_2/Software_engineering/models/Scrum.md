Agile development method which ==concentrates specifically on how to manage tasks within a team-based development environment==.

working in small teams (say- 7 to 9 members).

Scrum believes in empowering the development team

### <u>Three roles</u>

#### <u>Scrum Master:</u>
The scrum can set up the 
1. ==team==
2. arrange the ==meeting==  
3. remove ==obstacles== for the process 

#### <u>Product owner: </u>

The product owner 
1. makes the ==product backlog==, 
2. prioritizes the ==delay== 
3. is responsible for the distribution of functionality on each repetition.
4. The Product Owner is the ==primary point of contact on behalf of the customer ==to identify the product requirements for the development team.

#### <u>Scrum Team:</u>

The team manages its work and organizes the work to complete the ==sprint or cycle==.


### <u>Product Backlog</u>
  
 1. This is a <u>repository where requirements are tracked with details on the no of requirements(user stories) to be completed for each release. </u>
 2. maintained  by Product Owner, and it is be distributed to the scrum team. 
 3. Team can also request for a new requirement addition or modification or deletion



  Scrum is a hands-on system consisting of simple interlocking steps and components: 
  
  1. A product owner  --> makes a ==prioritized wish list== (product backlog). 
  2. The scrum team --> takes one small piece of the top of the wish list called a ==sprint backlog== and plans to implement it. 
  3. . The team completes their sprint backlog task in a sprint (a 2-4 week period). They assess progress in a meeting called a ==daily scrum==. 
 4. The ScrumMaster ==keeps the team focused== on the goal. 
 5. At the sprintâ€™s end, the work is ready to ship or show. The team closes the sprint with a review, then starts a new sprint.
