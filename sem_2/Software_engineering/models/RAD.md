The RAD (Rapid Application Development) model is a type of software development methodology that ==focuses on quick development cycles and frequent iterations==. It emphasizes prototyping, user feedback, and component reuse rather than extensive planning and documentation.

Phases of RAD Model

1. ==Business Modeling== – Understanding business processes and data flow.


2. ==Data Modeling== – Defining data structures based on business models.


3. ==Process Modeling== – Defining how data is processed to meet business needs.


4. ==Application Generation== – Rapidly developing the system using reusable components.


5. ==Testing and Deployment== – Quick testing cycles and continuous integration of user feedback.



## Advantages of RAD Model

1. Faster development and delivery.

2. Involves users early in development.

3. Encourages flexibility and adaptability.

4. Reduces development cost by reusing components.


## Disadvantages of RAD Model

1. Requires skilled developers and designers.

2. Not suitable for complex, high-security projects.

3. Heavy reliance on user feedback.


Use Cases of RAD Model

Web and mobile app development.

Prototyping-based software projects.

Projects with rapidly changing requirements.
