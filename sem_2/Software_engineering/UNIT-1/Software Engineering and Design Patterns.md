### Software def

Software is defined as a collection of programs, documentation and operating procedures. 
P P D O 
• The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) defines software as a ‘collection of computer programs, procedures, rules and associated documentation and data

 ==Software Engineering== is a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable study and approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of a software system.
 
 Software engineering is a **systematic**  and **disciplined** approach towards the development of the software operation +and maintenance.


### Why is Software Engineering required? 

1.  manage Large software 
2.  Scalability 
3.  Cost Manage
4.  manage dynamic nature of software 
5.  better quality

• Objectives of Software Engineering: 
1. Maintainability – It should be feasible for the software to evolve to meet changing requirements. 
2. Efficiency – The software should not make wasteful use of computing devices such as memory, processor cycles, etc. 
3. Correctness – A software product is correct if the different requirements as specified in the SRS document have been correctly implemented. 
4. Reusability – A software product has good reusability if the different modules of the product can easily be reused to develop new products.0
5. Testability – Here software facilitates both the establishment of test criteria and the evaluation of the software with respect to those criteria. 6. Reliability – It is an attribute of software quality. The extent to which a program can be expected to perform its desired function, over an arbitrary time period. 7. Portability – In this case, the software can be transferred from one computer system or environment to another. 8. Adaptability – In this case, the software allows differing system constraints and the user needs to be satisfied by making changes to the software. 9. Interoperability – Capability of 2 or more functional units to process data cooperatively.
