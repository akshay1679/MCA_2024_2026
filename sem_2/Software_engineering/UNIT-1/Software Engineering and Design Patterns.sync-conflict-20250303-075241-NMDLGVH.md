## Why is Software Engineering required? 

1.  manage Large software 
2.  Scalability 
3.  Cost Manage                                                          MSQ
4.  manage dynamic nature of software 
5.  better quality


 Objectives of Software Engineering: 
6. **Maintainability** – It should be feasible for the software to evolve to meet changing requirements. 
7. **Efficiency** – The software should not make wasteful use of computing devices such as memory, processor cycles, etc. 
8. **Correctness** – A software product is correct if the different requirements as specified in the SRS document have been ==correctly implemented==. 
9. **Reusability** – A software product has good reusability if the different modules of the product can easily be reused to develop new products.0
10. **Testability** – Here software facilitates both the ==establishment== of test criteria and the evaluation of the software with respect to those criteria. 
11. **Reliability** – It is an attribute of software quality. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">The extent to which a program can be expected to perform its desired function,</mark> over an arbitrary time period. 
12. **Portability** – In this case, the software can be transferred from one computer system or environment to another. 
13. **Adaptability** – In this case, the software allows differing system constraints and the user needs to be satisfied by making changes to the software. 
14. **Interoperability** – Capability of 2 or more functional units to process data cooperatively.

##  Program vs Software Product:

| Feature                    | **Program**                                                      | **Software Product**                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**             | ==A set of instructions written to perform a specific task==.    | ==A fully developed, tested, and packaged software solution designed for end-users.== |
| **Purpose**                | ==Solves a particular problem== or performs a specific function. | Meets broader user requirements with additional features, usability, and support.     |
| **Development Complexity** | Simple, often developed for personal or academic use.            | Complex, requires software engineering principles, testing, and maintenance.          |
| **Testing**                | ==Basic testing== for functionality.                             | ==Rigorously tested== for performance, security, and user experience.                 |
| **User Interface (UI)**    | May not have a user-friendly interface.                          | Designed with user experience in mind, often with a GUI.                              |

Software=Program+documentation+licensing

A program is one of the stages involved in the development of the software, whereas a software development usually follows a life cycle, which involves the **feasibility** study of the project, **requirement** gathering, development of a **prototype**, **system design**, **coding**, and **testing**.


## Classification of Software

==On the basis of application: ==
### **1. System Software**

- Manages ==computer resources== and ==supports application execution==.
- ==Essential for a computer to function.==
- A computer cannot function without the presence of these.

## Software Processes

  A software process is the set of ==activities== and ==associated outcome== that produce a software product. Software engineers mostly carry out these activities. These are four key process activities, which are common to all software processes. These activities are: 
 
 1.**Software specifications**: The functionality of the software and constraints on its operation must be defined. 

chatgpt: 
Software specifications are a ==detailed plan== that <u>describes what a software should do and how it should work</u>. It includes the features, rules, and technical details needed to build the software correctly. Think of it like a blueprint for a house—it guides developers to create the right product as expected.
 
 2.**Software development**: The software to meet the requirement must be produced. 
 
 3.**Software validation**: The software must be validated to ensure that <u> it does what the customer wants</u>. 
 
 4.**Software evolution**: The software must evolve to meet changing client needs.

==S.D.V.E==
## The Software Process Model

A software process model is a specified definition of a software process, which is presented from a particular perspective. 

Process models may contain activities, which are part of the software process, software product, and the roles of people involved in software engineering

1. **The waterfall approach:** This takes the above activities and produces them as separate process phases such as requirements specification, software design, implementation, testing, and so on. 
2. **Evolutionary development:** This method interleaves the activities of specification, development, and validation. An initial system is rapidly developed from a very abstract specification. 
3. **Formal transformation:** This method is based on producing a formal mathematical system specification and transforming this specification, using mathematical methods to a program. These transformations are 'correctness preserving.' This means that you can be sure that the developed programs meet its specification. 
4. **System assembly from reusable components:** This method assumes the parts of the system already exist. The system development process target on integrating these parts rather than developing them from scratch

## Software Crisis

1.**Size**: Software is becoming more expensive and more complex with the growing complexity and expectation out of software. For example, the ==code in the consumer product is doubling every couple of years==. 

2.**Quality**: ==Many software products have poor quality==, i.e., the software products defects after putting into use due to ==ineffective testing== technique. For example, Software testing typically finds 25 errors per 1000 lines of code. 

3.**Cost**: Software development is costly i.e. in terms of time taken to develop and the money involved. For ==example, Development of the FAA's Advanced Automation System cost over $700 per lines of code==. 

4.**Delayed Delivery**: Serious schedule overruns are common. ==Very often the software takes longer than the estimated time to develop, which in turn leads to cost shooting up==. For example, one in four large-scale development projects is never completed.

==S.Q.C.DD==
## Software Engineering - Layered technology

 Software engineering is a fully layered technology. 
 To develop a software, we need to go from one layer to another. 
 All these layers are related to each other and each layer demands the fulfillment of the previous layer.

![[UNIT-1 1.webp]]



 The layered technology consists of: 

#### 1 Quality focus (M.I.U)

The characteristics of good quality software are: 
1. Correctness of the functions required to be performed by the software. 
2.  ==Maintainability== of the software 
3.  ==Integrity== i.e. providing security so that the unauthorized user cannot access information or data. 
4. ==Usability== i.e. the efforts required to use or operate the software.




####  2. Process 

1. It is the ==base layer or foundation layer ==for the se. 
2. The software process is the ==key to keep all levels together==.  
3. It defines a framework that ==includes different activities and tasks==.  
4. In short, ==it covers all activities, actions and tasks required to be carried out for software development==.


####  3. Methods 

1. The method provides the answers of all 'how-to' that are asked during the process. 
2. It provides the technical way to implement the software. 
3. It includes collection of tasks starting from communication, requirement analysis, analysis and design modelling, program construction, testing and support.



#### 4. Tools 
1. The software engineering tool is an automated support for the software development.
2. The tools are integrated i.e the information created by one tool can be used by the other tool. 
 For example: The Microsoft publisher can be used as a web designing tool.

## Software Process Framework 

 The process of framework defines a small set of activities that are applicable to all types of projects.  The software process framework is a collection of task sets.  Task sets consist of a collection of small work tasks, project milestones, work productivity and software quality assurance points.

## Umbrella activities 

 Typical umbrella activities are: 
1. Software project tracking and control 
	1.  In this activity, the developing team accesses project plan and compares it with the predefined schedule. 
	2.  If these project plans do not match with the predefined schedule, then the required actions are taken to maintain the schedule. 
2. Risk management 
	1.  Risk is an event that may or may not occur. 
	2.  If the event occurs, then it causes some unwanted outcome. Hence, proper risk management is required.
3. Software Quality Assurance (SQA) 
	1.  SQA is the planned and systematic pattern of activities which are required to give a guarantee of software quality. For example, during the software development meetings are conducted at every stage of development to find out the defects and suggest improvements to produce good quality software. 
4. Formal Technical Reviews (FTR) 
	2.  FTR is a meeting conducted by the technical staff. 
	3.  The motive of the meeting is to detect quality problems and suggest improvements. 
	4.  The technical person focuses on the quality of the software from the customer point of view.  
5. Measurement 
	1.  Measurement consists of the effort required to measure the software. 
	2.  The software cannot be measured directly. It is measured by direct and indirect measures. 
	3.  Direct measures like cost, lines of code, size of software etc. 
	4.  Indirect measures such as quality of software which is measured by some other factor. Hence, it is an indirect measure of software.  
6. Software Configuration Management (SCM) 
	1.  It manages the effect of change throughout the software process.  
7. Reusability management 
	1.  It defines the criteria for reuse the product. 
	2.  The quality of software is good when the components of the software are developed for certain application and are useful for developing other applications.  
8. Work product preparation and production 
	1.  It consists of the activities that are needed to create the documents, forms, lists, logs and user manuals for developing a software. 
	2.  A software process is a collection of various activities.


There are five generic process framework activities: 
1. Communication 
2. Planning 
3. Modeling 
4. Construction 
5. Deployment

---
1. Communication: 
	1. The software development starts with the communication between customer and developer. 
2. Planning: 
	1. It consists of complete estimation, scheduling for project development and tracking. 
3. Modeling: 
	1. -  Modeling consists of complete requirement analysis and the design of the project like algorithm, flowchart etc. -  The algorithm is the step-by-step solution of the problem and the flow chart shows a complete flow diagram of a program. -  
4. Construction: -  
	1. Construction consists of code generation and the testing part. -  Coding part implements the design details using an appropriate programming language. -  Testing is to check whether the flow of coding is correct or not. -  Testing also check that the program provides desired output. -  
5. Deployment: 
	2. -  Deployment step consists of delivering the product to the customer and take feedback from them. -  If the customer wants some corrections or demands for the additional capabilities, then the change is required for improvement in the quality of the software.


## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) 

-  A software life cycle model (also termed process model) is a pictorial and diagrammatic representation of the software life cycle. 
-  A life cycle model represents all the methods required to make a software product transit through its life cycle stages. 
-  A life cycle model maps the various activities performed on a software product from its inception to retirement. Different life cycle models may plan the necessary development activities to phases in different ways. 
-  During any life cycle stage, more than one activity may also be carried out.

## Need of SDLC 
-  Without using an exact life cycle model, the development of a software product would not be in a systematic and disciplined manner. When a team is developing a software product, there must be a clear understanding among team representative about when and what to do. 
-  A software life cycle model describes entry and exit criteria for each phase. A phase can begin only if its stage-entry criteria have been fulfilled. So without a software life cycle model, the entry and exit criteria for a stage cannot be recognized. Without software life cycle models, it becomes tough for software project managers to monitor the progress of the project
