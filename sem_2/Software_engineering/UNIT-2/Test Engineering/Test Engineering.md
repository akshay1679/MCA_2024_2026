Fundamentals of Software Testing 

‚Ä¢ Software testing is the process of verifying and validating a software application to check whether it: 
‚Ä¢ Meets  requirements 
‚Ä¢ Fun correctly 
‚Ä¢ Ensures reliability, performance, and security ==RPT==
saves cost
ensure quality

### üîÑ Verification vs. ‚úÖ Validation

| **Aspect**       | **Verification**                                     | **Validation**                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**   | Ensures the product is built **according to specs**. | Ensures the product **meets user needs and expectations**.                         |
| **Key Question** | _Are we building the product right?_                 | _Are we building the right product?_                                               |
| **Purpose**      | To check **if the system is built correctly**.       | To check **if the right system is built**.                                         |
| **Timing**       | During development                                   | After or near the end of development                                               |
| **Techniques**   | - Reviews- Inspections- Walkthroughs- Static testing | - User Acceptance Testing (UAT)- Functional testing- Beta testing- Dynamic testing |
| **Example**      | Checking if login logic follows design specification | Checking if the login functionality satisfies user needs                           |

## Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

 1. Requirement Analysis
 2. Test Planning
 3. Test Case Development
 4. Test Environment Setup
 5. Test Execution
 6. Test Closure

##  Types of Software Testing

### üß™ Types of Software Testing

## <u>Functional Testing </u>


| **Type of Testing**               | **Purpose**                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Unit Testing**                  | Tests individual components or functions in isolation.                                                       |
| **Integration Testing**           | Tests how different components or modules work together.                                                     |
| **System Testing**                | Performs end-to-end testing of the entire integrated system.                                                 |
| **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** | Final validation performed by end-users to ensure the product meets their needs and is ready for deployment. |

| **Type of Testing**       | **Purpose**                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Performance Testing**   | Speed, load handling                                                        |
| **Security Testing**      | vulnerabilities                                                             |
| **Usability Testing**     | check ease of use                                                           |
| **Compatibility Testing** | Ensures the software works across **different devices, browsers, OS, etc.** |

### üé≠ **Testing Approaches**

|**Approach**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**White Box Testing**|Testing the **internal code structure**, logic, and flow of the software.|
|**Black Box Testing**|Testing the **functionality** of the software **without looking at the code**.|
|**Gray Box Testing**|A **hybrid approach** that combines both **white and black box testing**.|

‚Ä¢ The two fundamental testing techniques used to evaluate software functionality and internal structure are ==Black Box== Testing and ==White Box== Testing
