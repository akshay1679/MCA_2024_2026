### 🧠 **What is Analysis Modelling?**

- It’s like drawing a plan of what the software should do before starting to build it.
    
- It helps developers understand what the customer needs.
    
- It creates a technical blueprint by translating the customer’s needs into a format that designers and programmers can work with.
    

### 🔑 **Key Parts of Analysis Modelling:**

1. **Data Dictionary** – A glossary that explains all the data used in the software.
    
2. **ER Diagram (ERD)** – A diagram that shows how different data elements are connected.
    
3. **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** – Shows how data moves and changes in the system.
    
4. **State Transition Diagram** – Shows different states of the system and how it changes from one state to another.
    
5. **Process Specification** – Describes what each function does in detail.
    
6. **Control Specification** – Describes how the software reacts to events.
    
7. **Data Object Description** – Gives detailed info about each piece of data.

### 🧱 **What is Design Engineering?**

- It’s the process of creating a plan (design) to build the software system.
    
- The goal is to ensure the software is strong, useful, and enjoyable to use.
    

### 🏗️ **Types of Design Models:**

1. **Data/Class Design** – Structures and stores the data properly.
    
2. **Architectural Design** – Big picture of how the system parts fit together.
    
3. **Interface Design** – Describes how users or other systems interact with the software.
    
4. **Component-Level Design** – Breaks the system into smaller units and describes how they work.

### 📐 **Good Design Characteristics (Quality Guidelines):**

- Uses standard design patterns.
    
- Is modular (split into smaller parts).
    
- Has clear data, interfaces, and components.
    
- Uses efficient data structures and components.
    
- Easy to understand and maintain.
    

### ⭐ **Quality Attributes (FURPS):**

- **F**unctionality: What the software does.
    
- **U**sability: How easy it is to use.
    
- **R**eliability: How stable it is.
    
- **P**erformance: How fast it works.
    
- **S**upportability: How easy it is to fix or upgrade.

### 🛠️ **Software Design Concepts (Important Ideas):**

- **Abstraction**: Hide unnecessary details.
    
- **Modularity**: Break into parts.
    
- **Architecture**: The structure or blueprint.
    
- **Refinement**: Improve and detail out the design.
    
- **Patterns**: Use common solutions for repeated problems.
    
- **Information Hiding**: Hide private data from other parts.
    
- **Refactoring**: Clean up code/design without changing functionality.

### 🧩 **Levels of Design:**

1. **Architectural Design** – Overall structure.
    
2. **High-Level Design** – Major modules and their interactions.
    
3. **Detailed Design** – Inner workings of each module.

### 🧬 **System Elements:**

- **Architecture** – Overall structure.
    
- **Modules** – Small parts doing specific tasks.
    
- **Components** – Combine modules to provide features.
    
- **Interfaces** – Connect different parts.
    
- **Data** – Information the system handles.
