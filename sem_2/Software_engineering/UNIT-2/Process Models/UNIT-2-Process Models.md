### **Software Process Models and Selection Criteria**

#### **What is a Software Process Model?**

A software process model is an **abstract representation** of the software development process. It defines the **stages and order** of tasks, ensuring a structured workflow.

A model typically specifies:  
‚úÖ **Tasks to be performed**  
‚úÖ **Input and output of each task**  
‚úÖ **Pre and post-conditions for each task**  
‚úÖ **Flow and sequence of tasks**

The **goal** of a software process model is to provide **guidance for controlling and coordinating** development activities effectively.

### **Types of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Models**

Several SDLC models exist, each catering to different project needs:

üîπ **Waterfall Model** ‚Äì Linear and sequential development approach.  
üîπ **V Model** ‚Äì Emphasizes verification and validation at each stage.  
üîπ **Incremental Model** ‚Äì Develops software in small, manageable increments.  
üîπ **RAD (Rapid Application Development) Model** ‚Äì Prioritizes quick prototyping.  
üîπ **Agile Model** ‚Äì Iterative development with continuous feedback.  
üîπ **Iterative Model** ‚Äì Repeats development cycles for gradual improvement.  
üîπ **Prototype Model** ‚Äì Develops a preliminary version to refine requirements.  
üîπ **Spiral Model** ‚Äì Combines iterative and risk-driven approaches.

### **Factors in Choosing a Software Process Model**

‚úÖ **Project Requirements**

- Are requirements well-defined or will they evolve?
- Will users need to refine requirements after each iteration?

‚úÖ **Project Size**

- Small projects may require simpler models (e.g., Waterfall).
- Large projects require structured models (e.g., Spiral, Agile).

‚úÖ **Project Complexity**

- High complexity requires **frequent client feedback** and flexibility.
- If requirements change often, **Agile or Spiral** models are better.

‚úÖ **Cost of Delay**

- Time-sensitive projects need **Rapid Development Models** like Agile or RAD.

‚úÖ **Customer Involvement**

- If clients are involved throughout, Agile or Prototype models work best.

‚úÖ **Familiarity with Technology**

- The team's expertise in tools, languages, and domains affects model selection.

‚úÖ **Project Resources**

- Budget, manpower, and tools availability determine feasibility.

### **Prescriptive Process Model**

#### **What is it?**

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">A **Prescriptive Process Model** is a structured approach to software development that defines a set of systematic steps and guidelines to be followed for efficient and predictable project execution. It provides a well-defined framework, outlining tasks, workflows, deliverables, and best practices to ensure software development progresses in an organized manner.</mark>

A **Prescriptive Process Model** defines a structured set of:  
‚úÖ **Activities**  
‚úÖ **Tasks and milestones**  
‚úÖ **Work products required for high-quality software development**

#### **Who Uses It?**

- **Software Engineers** and **Project Managers** adapt and follow process models.

#### **Why is it Important?**

‚úî Ensures **stability, control, and organization** in software development.  
‚úî Provides **structured guidance** for achieving high-quality results.

This approach helps streamline software development by offering a **clear and systematic workflow**. üöÄ

### **Prescriptive Process Models**

Prescriptive process models provide a structured approach to software development by defining specific **activities, tasks, and milestones**. There are three main types:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Waterfall Model**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Incremental Process Model**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **RAD (Rapid Application Development) Model**

## **1. The Waterfall Model**

Also known as the **Linear Sequential Model** or **Classic Life Cycle Model**, this approach follows a strict, **step-by-step progression** where each phase is **fully completed before moving to the next**.This model is used for the small projects. ‚Ä¢ In this model, feedback is taken after each phase to ensure that the project is on the right path. ‚Ä¢ Testing part starts only after the development is complete.

### **Key Features:**

‚úî Best suited for ==**small projects**== with well-defined requirements.  
‚úî ==Feedback== is taken after each phase to ensure correctness.  
‚úî **==Testing begins only after development** is complete==.

### **Advantages:**

‚úÖ **Simple and easy** to understand and use.  
‚úÖ **Well-structured** since all requirements are defined from the start.  
‚úÖ **No overlapping phases**, making management easier.  
‚úÖ **Ensures high-quality output**, making it suitable for quality-focused projects.

### **Disadvantages:**

‚ùå **Not suitable for complex or object-oriented projects**.  
‚ùå **Inefficient for long-term projects** due to rigid structure.  
‚ùå **High risk**, as problems are discovered only during testing.  
‚ùå **Poor adaptability** to changing requirements.
