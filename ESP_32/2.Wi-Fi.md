Wi-Fi Example (Connect to Network)

Let's go through the Wi-Fi example code **line by line** to understand how it works.

### **Complete Code:**

```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>

const char* ssid = "Your_SSID";
const char* password = "Your_PASSWORD";

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(500);
    Serial.print(".");
  }
  Serial.println("\nConnected to WiFi!");
}

void loop() {
  // Your code here
}
```

## **Line-by-Line Explanation:**

### **1. Include the Wi-Fi Library**

```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>
```

- **`#include <WiFi.h>`**: This imports the built-in **WiFi** library for ESP32, which provides functions to connect to a network, create a hotspot, and communicate over Wi-Fi.
    

---

### **2. Define Wi-Fi Credentials**

```cpp
const char* ssid = "Your_SSID";
const char* password = "Your_PASSWORD";
```

- **`const char* ssid`**: Stores the Wi-Fi **network name** (SSID) as a string.
    
- **`const char* password`**: Stores the **Wi-Fi password** as a string.
    
- These values must be **replaced with your actual Wi-Fi credentials**.
    

---

### **3. Setup Function (Runs Once at Startup)**

```cpp
void setup() {
```

- **`setup()`** is a special function that runs once when the ESP32 **starts or resets**.
    
- It is mainly used for initializing **Wi-Fi, serial communication, sensors, or other modules**.
    

---

### **4. Initialize Serial Communication**

```cpp
Serial.begin(115200);
```

- **`Serial.begin(115200)`** initializes the serial communication at **115200 baud rate**.
    
- This allows us to print messages to the Serial Monitor in the **Arduino IDE** (for debugging).
    

---

### **5. Connect to Wi-Fi**

```cpp
WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
```

- **`WiFi.begin(ssid, password)`** starts the connection to the Wi-Fi network using the SSID and password.
    

---

### **6. Wait Until Wi-Fi is Connected**

```cpp
while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
  delay(500);
  Serial.print(".");
}
```

- **`WiFi.status()`** checks the current connection status.
    
- **`WL_CONNECTED`** is a constant that means **successfully connected to Wi-Fi**.
    
- The `while` loop **keeps checking the connection status** every 500ms.
    
- **`delay(500);`** pauses execution for 500 milliseconds.
    
- **`Serial.print(".");`** prints a dot `.` in the Serial Monitor to show that the ESP32 is trying to connect.
    

ðŸ‘‰ If the connection takes time, you will see `.....` printed continuously until it connects.

---

### **7. Print Connection Success Message**

```cpp
Serial.println("\nConnected to WiFi!");
```

- Once connected, `Serial.println("\nConnected to WiFi!");` prints a success message in the Serial Monitor.
    

---

### **8. Loop Function (Runs Repeatedly)**

```cpp
void loop() {
  // Your code here
}
```

- The **`loop()`** function runs **continuously** after `setup()` finishes.
    
- Currently, it's empty, but you can add **code to send or receive data over Wi-Fi**.
    

---

## **Expected Serial Monitor Output**

```
.....
.....
Connected to WiFi!
```

(The dots represent the connection attempt, and "Connected to WiFi!" appears once connected.)

---

## **Next Steps**

You can extend this by:

- Printing the **ESP32's IP address** after connecting:
    
    ```cpp
    Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());
    ```
    
- Running a **web server** or sending HTTP requests.
    
- Creating a **Wi-Fi hotspot** instead of connecting to a router.
