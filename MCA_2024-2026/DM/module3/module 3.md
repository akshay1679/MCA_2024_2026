Machine learning  is a growing    technology that lenables computer to learn automatically from past data   
  
it uses various algorithms for building  mathemathical model and making prediction using historical data information  
  
The form machine learning was introduced by Arthur Samuel 1959.  
  
Machine learning enables the machine to automatically  learn from data  Improve performance from experience  and predict things. 
  
Type of ML

1. Supervised  Learning  
  
2. Un Supervised learning

3. Reinforcement learning

## Supervised  Learning  

Supervised machine learning is based on supervision.  
  
In this technique, we train the machine using  "labelled dataset" and based on the training machine   predicts the outcome. 
  
The main goal of the  supervised learning tequnic is to map the input variable (x) with the output variable (y) 
  
Supervised Learning Type:  
  
1.  Classification
2. Regression

## Unsupervised Learning  
  
→ There is no   supervision
  
→The machine is trained using unlabeled dataset and the machine predicts the output.  
  
→ Aim of this algorithm is to group on  categories   The dataset according to similarities in pattern and difference

Two Type 
1. clustering
2.  Association

## Reinforcement Learning:  
  
learning from experiences  
  
- Reinforcement learning works on a on a feedback based  process in which an ai agent(software component ) automatically explores its surroundings learning from experience and improving its performance
- the agent gets rewarded for each good action and gets punished for each ba action hence the goal for reinforced learning agent is to minimise the rewards

## Frequent Pattern Mining

Frequent pattern refers  to subsequence or items ==complete==

# Applications  
  
## Market Basket Analysis  
  
In DM, it is to analyze the combination of product that has  been bought together  
  
It is used by retailers to increase sale  by better  understanding customer purchasing patterns.  
  
It involves analyzing large data sets, such purchase history to reveal product groupings, as well as products that are likely to be  purchased together  
  
Terms Associated with Frequent item Set  
  
1. Support  
  
2. Confidence  

  ---
###  Support  
  
Support refers to the relative frequency of an item in a dataset
  
The support of an item refers to  the number of transactions in which the element appears, divided by the total number of transactions
