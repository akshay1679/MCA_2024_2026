- [ ] Introduction to Data structures (Definition, types, classification)

- [ ] *Array data structures* (operations)
	- [ ] search
	- [ ] sort
	- [ ] traverse
	- [ ] insert
	- [ ] split
	- [ ] merge 
	- [ ] delete
- [ ] Search & Sort Algorithm 
- [ ] Linear search (
	- [ ] algorithm/
	- [ ] psuedo code,
	- [ ] problems)
- [ ]  binary search (
	- [ ] algorithm/
	- [ ] psuedo code,
	- [ ] problems)
- [ ] Bubble sort, (
	- [ ] algorithm/
	- [ ] psuedo code
	- [ ] problems)
- [ ] Insertion sort,(
	- [ ] algorithm/
	- [ ] psuedo code, 
	- [ ] problems)
- [ ] selection sort,(
	- [ ] algorithm/
	- [ ] psuedo code,
	- [ ] problems)
- [ ] shell sort (
	- [ ] algorithm/
	- [ ] psuedo code, 
	- [ ] problems)
*Linked list*
- [ ] Singly linked list 
- [ ] Doubly linked list
- [ ] Circular -linear only (doubly‚ùå)
	- [ ] Create, 
	- [ ] Traverse, 
	- [ ] insert, 
	- [ ] delete
- [ ] *Stack* Operations
- [ ] *Queue*
   1. Linear
   2. Circular 
- [ ] Double ended queue(Operations)
- [ ] what is abstract data type (adt)
Priority queue( theory only, definition, why priority queue?,no operations)

- [ ] write a search algo to search a particular name in a rank list (linear search)
