## What is an Operating System?

1. A program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware

2. Operating system goals:
	1. Execute user programs and make solving user problems easier
	2. Make the computer system convenient to use
	3. Use the computer hardware in an efficient manner

## OS Def :
1. OS is a resource allocator
	1. Manages all resources
	2. Decides between conflicting requests for efficient and fair resource use.

2. OS is a control program
	1. Controls execution of programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer

## Computer System Structure :

1. Computer system can be divided into four components:

	1. Hardware – provides basic computing resources
	+ CPU, memory, I/O devices
	
	2. Operating system
	+ Controls and coordinates use of hardware among various applications and users
	
	3. Application programs – define the ways in which the system resources are used to solve the computing problems of the users
	+ Word processors, compilers, web browsers, database systems, video games
	
	4. Users
	+ People, machines, other computers
