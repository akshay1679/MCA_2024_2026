## What is an Operating System?

1. A program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware

2. Operating system ==goals==:
	1. Execute user programs and make solving user problems easier
	2. Make the computer system convenient to use
	3. Use the computer hardware in an efficient manner

An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, providing services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and the hardware. The primary functions of an OS include:

1. **Resource Management:** Manages CPU, memory, disk space, and other hardware.
2. **File Management:** Handles the creation, deletion, and access of files on storage devices.
3. **Process Management:** Manages the execution of multiple processes by scheduling and coordinating them.
4. **Security:** Protects system resources and data from unauthorized access.
5. **User Interface:** Provides a way for users to interact with the system, either via command-line interfaces or graphical user interfaces (GUI).

Popular examples include Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## OS Def :
1. OS is a resource allocator
	1. Manages all resources
	2. Decides between conflicting requests for efficient and fair resource use.

2. OS is a control program
	1. Controls execution of programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer

## Computer System Structure :

1. Computer system can be divided into four components:

	1. Hardware – provides basic computing resources
		+ CPU, memory, I/O devices
	
	2. Operating system
		+ Controls and coordinates use of hardware among various applications and users
	
	3. Application programs – define the ways in which the system resources are used to solve the computing problems of the users
		+ Word processors, compilers, web browsers, database systems, video games
	
	4. Users
		+ People, machines, other computers

## Operating System Services

### 1-Process management

1. Process creation, deletion, suspension, resumption
2. Process synchronization 
3. Process communication
4. Deadlock handling

### 2-Main Memory Management

1. Allocate and de-allocate memory space as needed
2. Decide which process is to be loaded into memory 
3. Keeps track of memory locations

### 3-File management

1. Creation and deletion of files & directories
2. Backup 
3. Mapping files on to secondary storage
### 4-I/O system management

1. A general device driver interface		
2. Memory management component including buffering, caching, and spooling (not needed --> [[Memory spooling]] refers to the process of temporarily storing data or instructions in a buffer, or spool, in memory before they are processed)
### 5-Secondary Storage management

1. Free space management
2. Storage allocation
3. Disk Scheduling

### Protection

1. Mechanism for controlling the access of programs, processes, or users to the resources defined by the computer system 

### Command interpreter system

1. Interface between the user and the system
2. Often known as shell
3. Get the command and execute it
