## WHAT IS JAVA?

Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. 

It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure, and reliable, and it is widely used for developing Java applications in laptops, data centers, game consoles, scientific supercomputers, cell phones, etc.

Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network centric language. It is among the most used programming language. Java is also used as a computing platform.

## HISTORY OF JAVA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

The Java language was initially called OAK. 

Originally, it was developed for handling portable devices and set-top boxes. Oak was a massive failure. 

In 1995, Sun changed the name to “Java” and modified the language to take advantage of the burgeoning www (World Wide Web) development business. 

Later, in 2009, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems and took ownership of three key Sun software assets: Java, MySQL, and Solaris.

## WHAT IS JAVA PLATFORM?

 Java Platform is a collection of programs that help programmers to develop and run Java programming applications efficiently. 
 
  It includes an execution engine, a compiler, and a set of libraries in it. It is a set of computer software and specifications.

## JAVA VERSIONS

The latest version of Java is Java 16 or JDK 16 released on March, 16th 2021. 

## COMPONENTS OF JAVA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

COMPONENTS OF JAVA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE 
 A Java Programmer writes a program in a human-readable language called Source Code. Therefore, the CPU or Chips never understand the source code written in any programming language. 
 
  These computers or chips understand only one thing, which is called machine language or code. These machine codes run at the CPU level. Therefore, it would be different machine codes for other models of CPU.

## JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT (JDK)

JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT (JDK) 
 JDK is a software development environment used for making applets and Java applications. 
 The full form of JDK is Java Development Kit. Java developers can use it on Windows, macOS, Solaris, and Linux.
 JDK helps them to code and run Java programs. It is possible to install more than one JDK version on the same computer. 
 Main reasons for using JDK:
 JDK contains tools required to write Java programs and JRE to execute them. 
 It includes a compiler, Java application launcher, Appletviewer, etc. 
 Compiler converts code written in Java into byte code.
 Java application launcher opens a JRE, loads the necessary class, and executes its main method.
