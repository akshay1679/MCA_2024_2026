1. Oracle provides the option of using a **WHERE** Clause in an SQL query to apply filter on the rows retrieved.
2. When a where clause is added to the SQL query, the Oracle engine compares each record in the table with the condition specified in the where clause. The Oracle engine displays only those records that satisfy the, specified condition. 

### Syntax: 
SELECT * FROM **TableName** WHERE **Condition**;
