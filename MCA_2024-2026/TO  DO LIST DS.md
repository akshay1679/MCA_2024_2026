- [ ] Introduction to Data structures (Definition, types, classification)

- [ ] *Array data structures* (operations)
	- [ ] search
	- [ ] sort
	- [x] traverse
	- [x] insert
	- [ ] split
	- [ ] merge 
	- [x] delete
- [ ] Search & Sort Algorithm 
- [x] Linear search (
	- [x] algorithm/
	- [x] psuedo code,
	- [x] problems)
- [ ]  binary search (
	- [ ] algorithm/
		- [ ] recursive
		- [ ] non recursive
	- [x] psuedo code,
	- [x] problems)
- [ ] Bubble sort, (
	- [x] algorithm
	- [ ]  Algorithm features
		- [ ] adaptive 
		- [ ] inplace 
		- [ ] stable
		- [ ] graph
	- [x] psuedo code
	- [ ] problems)
- [ ] Insertion sort,(
	- [ ] algorithm/
	- [ ] psuedo code, 
	- [ ] problems)
	- [ ]  Algorithm features

	- [ ] problems)
	- [ ]  Algorithm features
		- [ ] adaptive 
		- [ ] inplace 
		- [ ] stable
		- [ ] graph
- [ ] shell sort (
	- [ ] algorithm/
	- [ ] psuedo code, 
	- [ ] problems)
*Linked list*
- [ ] Singly linked list 
	- [ ] Create, 
	- [ ] Traverse, 
	- [ ] insert, 
	- [ ] delete
- [ ] Doubly linked list
	- [ ] Create, 
	- [ ] Traverse, 
	- [ ] insert, 
	- [ ] delete
- [ ] Circular -linear only (doubly‚ùå)
	- [ ] Create, 
	- [ ] Traverse, 
	- [ ] insert, 
	- [ ] delete
- [ ] *Stack* Operations
- [ ] *Queue*
   1. Linear
   2. Circular 
- [ ] Double ended queue(Operations)
- [ ] what is abstract data type (adt)
Priority queue( theory only, definition, why priority queue?,no operations)

- [ ] write a search algo to search a particular name in a rank list (linear search)
