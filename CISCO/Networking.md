# IPv4 Packet Structure Explained

The image shows the structure of an IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) packet, which is the fundamental unit of data transmission in IPv4 networks. Here's a detailed explanation:

## Header Fields

1. **Version (4 bits)**: Indicates the IP version (4 for IPv4)
2. **IHL - Internet Header Length (4 bits)**: Specifies the header length in 32-bit words (minimum 5, meaning 20 bytes)
3. **DSCP - Differentiated Services Code Point (6 bits)**: Used for QoS (Quality of Service) to prioritize certain types of traffic
4. **ECN - Explicit Congestion Notification (2 bits)**: Helps manage network congestion without dropping packets
5. **Total Length (16 bits)**: The total size of the IP packet (header + data) in bytes (max 65,535 bytes)

6. **Identification (16 bits)**: Helps identify fragments of the same original packet
7. **Flags (3 bits)**: Controls fragmentation (Don't Fragment, More Fragments)
8. **Fragment Offset (13 bits)**: Indicates where this fragment belongs in the original packet

9. **Time to Live - TTL (8 bits)**: Limits packet lifespan (decremented at each router, packet discarded at 0)
10. **Protocol (8 bits)**: Identifies the next-level protocol (TCP=6, UDP=17, etc.)
11. **Header Checksum (16 bits)**: Error-checking for the header only

12. **Source Address (32 bits)**: IP address of the sender
13. **Destination Address (32 bits)**: IP address of the receiver
14. **Options (variable)**: Optional fields (rarely used in practice)

## Payload

- **Data**: The actual content being transmitted (TCP segment, UDP datagram, etc.)

## Key Notes

- The standard IPv4 header is **20 bytes** (without options)
- The maximum packet size is **65,535 bytes** (including header)
- The header may grow up to **60 bytes** if options are used (IHL field can indicate up to 15 words)

This structure allows IPv4 to route packets across networks while providing basic services like fragmentation, time-to-live, and addressing.

# ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Explained

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a fundamental networking protocol used to map **IP addresses to MAC addresses** on a local network. Here's a detailed explanation:

## What ARP Does

- Resolves **Layer 3 (IP) addresses to Layer 2 (MAC) addresses**
    
- Essential for communication within the same local network (LAN)
    
- Works only within the same broadcast domain (doesn't cross routers)
    

## How ARP Works (The ARP Process)

1. **ARP Request (Broadcast)**:
    
    - When a device needs to send data to another device on the same network, it first checks its ARP cache.
        
    - If no entry exists, it broadcasts an ARP request packet asking "Who has IP address X.X.X.X? Tell me your MAC address."
        
2. **ARP Reply (Unicast)**:
    
    - The device with the requested IP address responds directly to the sender with its MAC address.
        
    - The requesting device stores this mapping in its ARP cache for future use.
        

## ARP Packet Structure

- **Hardware Type**: Type of network (Ethernet = 1)
    
- **Protocol Type**: Protocol being mapped (IPv4 = 0x0800)
    
- **Hardware Size**: MAC address length (6 bytes)
    
- **Protocol Size**: IP address length (4 bytes)
    
- **Opcode**: Request (1) or Reply (2)
    
- **Sender MAC/IP**: Source device information
    
- **Target MAC/IP**: Destination device information
    

## ARP Cache

- Devices maintain an **ARP table** that stores recent IP-to-MAC mappings
    
- Entries typically expire after 2-20 minutes (configurable)
    
- Can be viewed with `arp -a` (Windows/Linux/macOS)
    

## Special Cases

- **Gratuitous ARP**: A device announces its own IP-to-MAC mapping (used for duplicate IP detection)
    
- **Proxy ARP**: A router responds to ARP requests on behalf of another device
    

## Security Considerations

- **ARP Spoofing**: Attackers can send fake ARP replies to intercept traffic (basis for MITM attacks)
    
- **ARP Inspection**: Security feature that validates ARP packets (used in enterprise networks)
    

## Example Use Case

When your computer (192.168.1.10) wants to communicate with a printer (192.168.1.5) on the same network:

1. Your computer checks its ARP cache for 192.168.1.5
    
2. If not found, broadcasts "Who has 192.168.1.5?"
    
3. The printer replies "I have 192.168.1.5, my MAC is 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E"
    
4. Your computer stores this mapping and uses it to send frames directly to the printer
    

ARP operates at **Layer 2** of the OSI model and is crucial for Ethernet networks to function properly.

is arp used in ddns

is arp used in ddns or dns

No, **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** is not directly used in **DDNS (Dynamic DNS)** or **DNS (Domain Name System)**. These protocols operate at different layers of the networking stack and serve different purposes.

### **Key Differences:**

| Protocol | Layer                     | Purpose                                                                       | Used in DNS/DDNS? |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **ARP**  | **Layer 2 (Data Link)**   | Maps **IP → MAC address** (for local network communication)                   | ❌ No              |
| **DNS**  | **Layer 7 (Application)** | Maps **domain names → IP addresses** (e.g., `google.com` → `142.250.190.46`)  | ✅ Yes             |
| **DDNS** | **Layer 7 (Application)** | Automatically updates DNS records when an IP changes (e.g., for home servers) | ✅ Yes             |

### **Why ARP is Not Used in DNS/DDNS?**

1. **Different Layers**
    
    - ARP works at **Layer 2 (MAC addresses)** and is only relevant within a **local network (LAN)**.
        
    - DNS/DDNS work at **Layer 7 (domain names)** and are used globally (WAN).
        
2. **Different Functions**
    
    - ARP resolves **IP → MAC** (for Ethernet/Wi-Fi communication).
        
    - DNS resolves **domain name → IP** (for internet-wide routing).
        
    - DDNS **dynamically updates DNS records** when an IP changes (e.g., for a home server with a changing ISP-assigned IP).
        
3. **No Direct Interaction**
    
    - A DNS query does not require ARP because it relies on **UDP/TCP (Layer 4)** and **IP routing (Layer 3)**.
        
    - ARP is only needed when a device communicates **within the same subnet**.
        

### **When ARP and DNS Might Indirectly Interact**

- If a device queries a **local DNS server** (e.g., a router or Pi-hole), ARP may be used to find the MAC address of that DNS server.
    
- However, **public DNS (like Google’s 8.8.8.8)** does not use ARP—it relies on standard IP routing.
    

### **Conclusion**

- **ARP is for local network communication (MAC ↔ IP).**
    
- **DNS/DDNS are for internet-wide name resolution (domain ↔ IP).**
    
- They operate at different layers and do not directly interact.

# Transport layer

![[Pasted image 20250612153709.png]]

ip address are logic address

## client and server

client --> initiates connecttion
server  --> Accepts connection

client -->  <-- server  will have ==full duplex== connection

![[Pasted image 20250612154001.png]]


## TCP and UDP

![[Pasted image 20250612154155.png]]

when initiating connection in transp layer there will be 2 ports source port and destination port

destination port --> port open on server side

## ==application and ports==


![[Pasted image 20250612154500.png]]

each ports have different default ports 


## multipluxing and de multipluxing

![[Pasted image 20250612154959.png]]

**multiplexing** is a technique used to combine multiple signals or data streams into one signal over a shared medium or channel. This allows efficient use of available bandwidth and enables multiple devices or applications to communicate simultaneously.

in transport layer headders will be different and there will be diff ports ie diff pairs of source port and destination port 

**Demultiplexing** is the **reverse process of multiplexing**. It occurs at the **receiving end**, where the combined data stream is **separated and delivered** to the correct application or process.

![[Pasted image 20250612155921.png]]

16 bits for source port and 16 bits for destinaton port

65535 is the largest port possible

registered ports --> used for coustom made protocol port  

![[Pasted image 20250612160524.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250612160627.png]]

ans client selects free ports > 1024 ie (not able to select from well-known port or system port) not allowed to use well-known port as source port

well-known port  --> used in server side

## Network socket

![[Pasted image 20250612161219.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250612161431.png]]
⬆️ destination port is 443 means HTTPS protocol

established --> is the state of connection

![[Pasted image 20250612164249.png]]

will accept any segment   no matter the source port and source ip add only it should be TCP protocol 

==dns port ?==
