# IPv4 Packet Structure Explained

The image shows the structure of an IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) packet, which is the fundamental unit of data transmission in IPv4 networks. Here's a detailed explanation:

## Header Fields

1. **Version (4 bits)**: Indicates the IP version (4 for IPv4)
2. **IHL - Internet Header Length (4 bits)**: Specifies the header length in 32-bit words (minimum 5, meaning 20 bytes)
3. **DSCP - Differentiated Services Code Point (6 bits)**: Used for QoS (Quality of Service) to prioritize certain types of traffic
4. **ECN - Explicit Congestion Notification (2 bits)**: Helps manage network congestion without dropping packets
5. **Total Length (16 bits)**: The total size of the IP packet (header + data) in bytes (max 65,535 bytes)

6. **Identification (16 bits)**: Helps identify fragments of the same original packet
7. **Flags (3 bits)**: Controls fragmentation (Don't Fragment, More Fragments)
8. **Fragment Offset (13 bits)**: Indicates where this fragment belongs in the original packet

9. **Time to Live - TTL (8 bits)**: Limits packet lifespan (decremented at each router, packet discarded at 0)
10. **Protocol (8 bits)**: Identifies the next-level protocol (TCP=6, UDP=17, etc.)
11. **Header Checksum (16 bits)**: Error-checking for the header only

12. **Source Address (32 bits)**: IP address of the sender
13. **Destination Address (32 bits)**: IP address of the receiver
14. **Options (variable)**: Optional fields (rarely used in practice)

## Payload

- **Data**: The actual content being transmitted (TCP segment, UDP datagram, etc.)

## Key Notes

- The standard IPv4 header is **20 bytes** (without options)
- The maximum packet size is **65,535 bytes** (including header)
- The header may grow up to **60 bytes** if options are used (IHL field can indicate up to 15 words)

This structure allows IPv4 to route packets across networks while providing basic services like fragmentation, time-to-live, and addressing.

# ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Explained

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a fundamental networking protocol used to map **IP addresses to MAC addresses** on a local network. Here's a detailed explanation:

## What ARP Does

- Resolves **Layer 3 (IP) addresses to Layer 2 (MAC) addresses**
    
- Essential for communication within the same local network (LAN)
    
- Works only within the same broadcast domain (doesn't cross routers)
    

## How ARP Works (The ARP Process)

1. **ARP Request (Broadcast)**:
    
    - When a device needs to send data to another device on the same network, it first checks its ARP cache.
        
    - If no entry exists, it broadcasts an ARP request packet asking "Who has IP address X.X.X.X? Tell me your MAC address."
        
2. **ARP Reply (Unicast)**:
    
    - The device with the requested IP address responds directly to the sender with its MAC address.
        
    - The requesting device stores this mapping in its ARP cache for future use.
        

## ARP Packet Structure

- **Hardware Type**: Type of network (Ethernet = 1)
    
- **Protocol Type**: Protocol being mapped (IPv4 = 0x0800)
    
- **Hardware Size**: MAC address length (6 bytes)
    
- **Protocol Size**: IP address length (4 bytes)
    
- **Opcode**: Request (1) or Reply (2)
    
- **Sender MAC/IP**: Source device information
    
- **Target MAC/IP**: Destination device information
    

## ARP Cache

- Devices maintain an **ARP table** that stores recent IP-to-MAC mappings
    
- Entries typically expire after 2-20 minutes (configurable)
    
- Can be viewed with `arp -a` (Windows/Linux/macOS)
    

## Special Cases

- **Gratuitous ARP**: A device announces its own IP-to-MAC mapping (used for duplicate IP detection)
    
- **Proxy ARP**: A router responds to ARP requests on behalf of another device
    

## Security Considerations

- **ARP Spoofing**: Attackers can send fake ARP replies to intercept traffic (basis for MITM attacks)
    
- **ARP Inspection**: Security feature that validates ARP packets (used in enterprise networks)
    

## Example Use Case

When your computer (192.168.1.10) wants to communicate with a printer (192.168.1.5) on the same network:

1. Your computer checks its ARP cache for 192.168.1.5
    
2. If not found, broadcasts "Who has 192.168.1.5?"
    
3. The printer replies "I have 192.168.1.5, my MAC is 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E"
    
4. Your computer stores this mapping and uses it to send frames directly to the printer
    

ARP operates at **Layer 2** of the OSI model and is crucial for Ethernet networks to function properly.

is arp used in ddns

is arp used in ddns or dns

No, **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** is not directly used in **DDNS (Dynamic DNS)** or **DNS (Domain Name System)**. These protocols operate at different layers of the networking stack and serve different purposes.

### **Key Differences:**

| Protocol | Layer                     | Purpose                                                                       | Used in DNS/DDNS? |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **ARP**  | **Layer 2 (Data Link)**   | Maps **IP → MAC address** (for local network communication)                   | ❌ No              |
| **DNS**  | **Layer 7 (Application)** | Maps **domain names → IP addresses** (e.g., `google.com` → `142.250.190.46`)  | ✅ Yes             |
| **DDNS** | **Layer 7 (Application)** | Automatically updates DNS records when an IP changes (e.g., for home servers) | ✅ Yes             |

### **Why ARP is Not Used in DNS/DDNS?**

1. **Different Layers**
    
    - ARP works at **Layer 2 (MAC addresses)** and is only relevant within a **local network (LAN)**.
        
    - DNS/DDNS work at **Layer 7 (domain names)** and are used globally (WAN).
        
2. **Different Functions**
    
    - ARP resolves **IP → MAC** (for Ethernet/Wi-Fi communication).
        
    - DNS resolves **domain name → IP** (for internet-wide routing).
        
    - DDNS **dynamically updates DNS records** when an IP changes (e.g., for a home server with a changing ISP-assigned IP).
        
3. **No Direct Interaction**
    
    - A DNS query does not require ARP because it relies on **UDP/TCP (Layer 4)** and **IP routing (Layer 3)**.
        
    - ARP is only needed when a device communicates **within the same subnet**.
        

### **When ARP and DNS Might Indirectly Interact**

- If a device queries a **local DNS server** (e.g., a router or Pi-hole), ARP may be used to find the MAC address of that DNS server.
    
- However, **public DNS (like Google’s 8.8.8.8)** does not use ARP—it relies on standard IP routing.
    

### **Conclusion**

- **ARP is for local network communication (MAC ↔ IP).**
    
- **DNS/DDNS are for internet-wide name resolution (domain ↔ IP).**
    
- They operate at different layers and do not directly interact.

# Transport layer

![[Pasted image 20250612153709.png]]

ip address are logic address

## client and server

client --> initiates connecttion
server  --> Accepts connection

client -->  <-- server  will have ==full duplex== connection

![[Pasted image 20250612154001.png]]


## TCP and UDP

![[Pasted image 20250612154155.png]]

when initiating connection in transp layer there will be 2 ports source port and destination port

destination port --> port open on server side

## ==application and ports==


![[Pasted image 20250612154500.png]]

each ports have different default ports 


## multipluxing and de multipluxing

![[Pasted image 20250612154959.png]]

**multiplexing** is a technique used to combine multiple signals or data streams into one signal over a shared medium or channel. This allows efficient use of available bandwidth and enables multiple devices or applications to communicate simultaneously.

in transport layer headders will be different and there will be diff ports ie diff pairs of source port and destination port 

**Demultiplexing** is the **reverse process of multiplexing**. It occurs at the **receiving end**, where the combined data stream is **separated and delivered** to the correct application or process.

![[Pasted image 20250612155921.png]]

16 bits for source port and 16 bits for destinaton port

65535 is the largest port possible

registered ports --> used for coustom made protocol port  

![[Pasted image 20250612160524.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250612160627.png]]

ans client selects free ports > 1024 ie (not able to select from well-known port or system port) not allowed to use well-known port as source port

well-known port  --> used in server side

## Network socket

![[Pasted image 20250612161219.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250612161431.png]]
⬆️ destination port is 443 means HTTPS protocol

established --> is the state of connection

### 🧠 What Happens Here:

- Two LAN segments are connected using a **bridge**.
    
- The bridge **learns the MAC addresses** of devices on each side.
    
- If **Computer A sends a message to Computer B**:
    
    - The bridge **does NOT forward** the message to the other segment—**it keeps traffic local**.
        
- If **Computer A sends a message to Computer D**:
    
    - The bridge **forwards** it to the correct segment.
        

---

### 🏢 **Real-World Example:**

Let’s say you work in an old building where:

- The **first floor** has HR and is wired using old Ethernet.
    
- The **second floor** has Finance, also using Ethernet.
    

The building has two separate networks. Instead of merging them with a router (which works at Layer 3), you use a **bridge**:

✅ It allows both floors to communicate **like one network**,  
✅ But filters unnecessary traffic to reduce network load.

---

### 📌 Summary:

- A **bridge connects** two LANs.
    
- It **filters** traffic using MAC addresses.
    
- Today, **switches** do this more efficiently, so bridges are mostly historical.
    


## L2TP

**Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)** is a **VPN (Virtual Private Network) tunneling protocol** used to support the secure transmission of data over public networks like the internet. It operates at the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)** of the OSI model.

---

### 🔍 What is L2TP?

L2TP is a **protocol used to tunnel Layer 2 (data link layer) frames** from one device to another over an IP network. It is often used in combination with **IPSec** (which provides encryption and authentication), because L2TP **by itself does not offer encryption**.

---

### 🔒 Key Features of L2TP:

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**Layer**|Works at **Layer 2** (Data Link Layer)|
|**Encryption**|**None** (used with **IPSec** for security)|
|**Encapsulation**|Encapsulates PPP frames for transmission over IP|
|**Usage**|Commonly used for VPNs|
|**Port**|UDP port **1701**|

---

### 🔧 ==How L2TP Works (with IPSec)==:

1. **User initiates VPN connection** to L2TP server.
    
2. A **secure IPSec tunnel** is established (using encryption).
    
3. L2TP packets (containing PPP frames) are **tunneled through the IPSec tunnel**.
    
4. Data is transmitted securely through this combined tunnel.
    

---

### 📘 Example Use Case:

- **A remote employee** connects to their company’s internal network using an L2TP/IPSec VPN. L2TP encapsulates the data, and IPSec ensures it’s encrypted and secure.
    

---

### ✅ Summary:

|Term|Description|
|---|---|
|**L2TP**|A tunneling protocol that carries PPP traffic over IP|
|**Layer**|Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)|
|**Security**|Needs IPSec for encryption|
|**Use**|VPNs and secure remote access|

### 🔁 How It Works:

1. **Workstation A** sends an Ethernet frame to Workstation B.
    
2. The frame includes:
    
    - Destination MAC = B’s MAC
        
    - Source MAC = A’s MAC
        
3. The **switch** looks at the destination MAC and forwards it to the correct port (where B is connected).
    
4. If the frame carries IP data, the EtherType will be `0x0800` (IPv4).
    
5. If it's going to the Internet, the switch forwards it to the **router**.

## 🔌 ==Types of Twisted Pair Cables and Their Speeds
==
Twisted pair cables are the most commonly used cables in Ethernet networks. They come in different **categories (Cat)**, each supporting different **speeds and distances**.

---

### 🧵 1. **Types of Twisted Pair Cables**

|Category|Speed|Max Distance|Shielding|Use Case|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Cat3**|10 Mbps|100 m|UTP|Old telephone and 10BASE-T Ethernet|

## What is a Router?

forwards data packets between computer networks.
By sending data packets to their intended [IP addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/),
devices that are operated on the Network Layer

---

### 🌐 **How Does a Router Work?**

A **router** is a networking device that directs data packets between devices and networks — including access to the internet. Its main job is to determine the best path for sending data to its destination.

---

### 🔍 **Step-by-Step: How a Router Works**

1. **Reads the Destination IP Address**  
    When a router receives a data packet, it examines the **destination IP address** in the packet's header.
    
2. **Checks the Routing Table**  
    The router compares the destination IP with its **routing table** — a database of known networks and paths — to determine where to send the packet next.
    
3. **Forwards the Packet**  
    Based on the best match in the routing table, the router sends the packet to the next hop, which could be another router or the final destination device.
    

---

### 📘 **Routing Tables**

Routing tables tell the router **how to reach specific networks**. They include:

- **Destination IP**
    
- **Subnet mask**
    
- **Next hop/router**
    
- **Interface to use**
    
- **Metric** (used to choose the best path)
    

> A **default route** (or default gateway) is often included to handle any packets that don’t match specific entries.

---

### ⚙️ **Static vs. Dynamic Routing Tables**

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|**Static Routing**|Manually configured by the network admin. Doesn’t change unless updated manually.|
|**Dynamic Routing**|Automatically updated using routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, or BGP. Adjusts to network changes.|

---

### 🌍 **Router and Internet Access**

To connect devices to the internet:

- The router connects to a **modem** (e.g., DSL, cable, or fiber) which acts as a bridge to the ISP.
    
- It assigns **local IP addresses** to devices using **DHCP**.
    
- It **translates private IPs to public IPs** using **NAT** (Network Address Translation).
    

---

### 🔌 **Ports and Connectivity**

Most routers offer:

- **Multiple LAN ports** for wired connections.
    
- **Wi-Fi** capability for wireless devices.
    
- **WAN port** to connect to the modem/internet.

## Types of Computer Network Architecture

1. **Client-Server Architecture:**
2. **Peer-to-Peer Architecture:**

The P2P --> any participant in the network known as a node ==acts as both a client and a server.== 

## ****Types of P2P Networks****

- ****Unstructured P2P Networks:**** In this type of P2P network, each device is able to make an equal contribution. This network is easy to build as devices can be connected randomly in the network. But being unstructured, it becomes difficult to find content. For example, Napster, Gnutella, etc.
![[Pasted image 20250614143737.png]]
- ****Structured P2P Networks:**** It is designed using software that creates a virtual layer in order to put the nodes in a specific structure. These are not easy to set up but can give easy access to users to the content. For example, P-Grid, Kademlia, etc. 
![[Pasted image 20250614143708.png]]
- ****Hybrid P2P Networks:**** It combines the features of both P2P networks and [client-server architecture](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/client-server-architecture-system-design/). An example of such a network is to find a node using the central server.+


## ==Network Devices
==


Here's a table showing **which OSI layer** each networking device belongs to or operates at. Some devices span multiple layers:

| **Device**                       | **OSI Layer**                                                   | **Explanation**                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Access Point**                 | Layer 2 (Data Link) / Layer 1 (Physical)                        | Connects wireless devices to a wired network, often operates at Layer 2.        |
| **Modem**                        | Layer 1 (Physical) / Layer 2 (Data Link)                        | Modulates and demodulates signals; converts digital to analog (and vice versa). |
| **Firewall**                     | Layer 3 (Network) / Layer 4 (Transport) / Layer 7 (Application) | Filters traffic by IP, ports, protocols, and sometimes packet content.          |
| **Repeater**                     | Layer 1 (==Physical==)                                          | Regenerates and amplifies signals to extend network range.                      |
| **Hub**                          | Layer 1 (==Physical==)                                          | Broadcasts data to all ports; no intelligence.                                  |
| **Bridge**                       | Layer 2 (==Data Link)==                                         | Connects two LAN segments and filters traffic based on MAC addresses.           |
| **Switch**                       | Layer 2 (==Data Link==) / Some at Layer 3                       | Connects devices in a LAN; forwards frames using MAC addresses.                 |
| **Router**                       | Layer 3 (Network)                                               | Routes packets between different networks based on IP addresses.                |
| **Gateway**                      | All 7 layers (typically 3–7)                                    | Acts as a protocol translator between different networks.                       |
| **Brouter**                      | Layer 3 (Network) & Layer 2 (Data Link)                         | Acts as both a bridge and router.                                               |
| **NIC (Network Interface Card)** | Layer 2 (Data Link) / Layer 1 (Physical)                        | Provides hardware interface between computer and network.                       |

### ****Types of Hub****

- ****Active Hub:**** These are the hubs that have their power supply and can clean, boost, and relay the signal along with the network. It serves both as a repeater as well as a wiring center. These are used to extend the maximum distance between nodes.

- ****Passive Hub:**** These are the hubs that collect wiring from nodes and power supply from the active hub. These hubs relay signals onto the network without cleaning and boosting them and can't be used to extend the distance between nodes.

- ****Intelligent Hub:**** It works like an active hub and includes remote management capabilities. They also provide flexible data rates to network devices. It also enables an administrator to monitor the traffic passing through the hub and to configure each port in the hub.



### 🔗 **What are Bridges in Networking?**

A **bridge** is a network device that connects and filters traffic between **two or more network segments** at the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)** of the **OSI model**.

---

### ✅ **Key Functions of a Bridge:**

1. **Connects Two LANs:**
    
    - Example: Connects two Ethernet segments to make them function as a single LAN.
        
2. **Filters Traffic Using MAC Addresses:**
    
    - Learns which MAC addresses are on each side and forwards traffic only where needed.
        
3. **Reduces Network Traffic:**
    
    - By isolating collision domains, it reduces unnecessary traffic (unlike a hub).
        
4. **No IP Understanding:**
    
    - Operates only at the MAC address level; doesn’t read IP addresses.
        

---

### 🧠 **How It Works:**

- It builds a **MAC address table** as it receives frames.
    
- When a frame arrives, it checks the destination MAC:
    
    - If known → forwards it to the correct port.
        
    - If unknown → broadcasts it to all ports except the one it came from.
        

---

### 📦 **Types of Bridges:**

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|**Transparent Bridge**|Most common; learning bridge that doesn’t need configuration.|
|**Translational Bridge**|Connects different types of networks (e.g., Ethernet ↔ Token Ring).|
|**Source Routing Bridge**|Used in Token Ring networks, uses source routing information.|

---

### 🏗️ **Analogy:**

Think of a bridge as a **traffic cop** at an intersection. It decides which vehicles (data frames) should cross to the other side and which should not — based on their destination license plates (MAC addresses).

---

Let me know if you want a diagram or comparison with switches and routers.


Here’s a **comparison table** and a **diagram** to help you clearly understand how **Bridges**, **Switches**, and **Routers** differ:

- **Bridge**: Connects 2 smaller LANs (acts as a filter).
    
- **Switch**: Smart bridge for multiple ports — common in LANs.
    
- **Router**: Connects different networks using IP addresses.
    

---

### ✅ Example Use Case:

- **Bridge**: Connecting a wired lab with a wireless office using MAC-level filtering.
    
- **Switch**: A classroom or office LAN with many PCs.
    
- **Router**: Connecting your home LAN to the Internet via your ISP.
    

### 🌐 **What is a Brouter?**

A **Brouter** (short for **Bridge Router**) is a **hybrid device** that combines the functions of both a **bridge** and a **router**.

---

### 🧠 **OSI Layer:**

- **Layer 3 (Network Layer)** → Functions as a **router** for **routable protocols** (e.g., IP).
    
- **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)** → Functions as a **bridge** for **non-routable protocols** (e.g., legacy protocols like NetBEUI, some AppleTalk, etc.).
    

---

### ✅ **Main Functions:**

|Function Type|Description|
|---|---|
|**Routing**|Routes **IP packets** between different networks based on IP addresses.|
|**Bridging**|Bridges traffic **within the same network** using **MAC addresses** for protocols it can’t route.|

---

### 📦 **Why Use a Brouter?**

- To **connect two networks** that use **different protocols**.
    
- To handle both **routable** and **non-routable** traffic in one device.
    
- It was more useful when legacy (non-routable) protocols were common.
    

---

### 🖼️ **Analogy:**

Imagine a **bilingual gatekeeper**:

- For people who speak a known language (IP), he gives directions (routes them).
    
- For those who don’t (non-routable protocols), he just passes them through to the correct department (bridges them).
    

---

### 🔍 **Modern Use:**

- **Rarely used today** because almost all modern protocols (especially TCP/IP) are routable.
    
- Routers and switches have largely taken over the roles of brouters with more advanced capabilities.

****In HTTP**** communication is unsecured and in ****HTTPS**** secured communication using [SSL/TLS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-secure-socket-layer-ssl-and-transport-layer-security-tls/) encryption.

****(DNS):**** [DNS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/domain-name-system-dns-in-application-layer/) Translates human-friendly domain names into IP addresses.

 The length of an IPv4 address is 32 bits, hence, we have 232 IP addresses available. The length of an IPv6 address is 128 bits.

****RARP:**** [RARP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-rarp/) stands for ****Reverse Address Resolution Protocol****. As the name suggests, it provides the IP address of the device given a physical address as input. But RARP has become obsolete since the time DHCP has come into the picture.

## DNS


![[Pasted image 20250614174621.png]]

DNS works efficiently, translating user-friendly domain names into IP addresses, allowing seamless navigation on the internet. Below step by step working of DNS:

- ****User Input:**** When a user enters a domain name in a browser, the system needs to find its [IP address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/).
- ****DNS Query:**** The user's device sends a DNS query to the DNS resolver.
- ****Resolver Request:**** The DNS resolver checks its cache for the IP address. If not found, it forwards the request to the root DNS server.
- ****Root DNS Server:**** The root DNS server provides the address of the TLD (Top-Level Domain) server for the specific domain extension (e.g., .com).
- ****TLD DNS Server:**** The TLD server directs the resolver to the authoritative DNS server for the actual domain.
- ****Authoritative DNS Server:**** The authoritative DNS server knows the IP address for the domain and provides it to the resolver.
- ****Response to User:**** The resolver stores the IP address in its cache and sends it to the user's device.
- ****Access Website****: With the IP address, the user's device can access the desired website.

### 📌 **Key Differences:**

- **Internet** is for **everyone** (worldwide).
    
- **Intranet** is for **internal use only**.
    
- **Extranet** is a **limited extension** of the intranet to **selected outsiders**.

### 🧠 **Analogy:**

- **Internet** = A public library anyone can enter.
    
- **Intranet** = A private office library for employees only.
    
- **Extranet** = Inviting business partners to access selected shelves of your office library.

## Network Address Translation(NAT)

****Network Address Translation (NAT)**** is a process in which one or more local IP addresses are translated into one or more Global IP addresses and vice versa to provide Internet access to the local hosts. It also does the translation of port numbers, i.e., masks the port number of the host with another port number in the packet that will be routed to the destination. It then makes the corresponding entries of IP address and port number in the NAT table. NAT generally operates on a [router or firewall](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-router-and-firewall/).

![[Pasted image 20250615110616.png]]

## ****Working of Network Address Translation (NAT)****

Generally, the border router is configured for NAT i.e. the router which has one interface in the local (inside) network and one interface in the global (outside) network. When a packet traverse outside the local (inside) network, then NAT converts that local (private) IP address to a global (public) IP address. When a packet enters the local network, the global (public) IP address is converted to a local (private) IP address. 

==If NAT runs out of addresses, i.e., no address is left in the pool configured then the packets will be dropped and an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) host unreachable packet to the destination is sent.==

## ****Types of Network Address Translation (NAT)****

There are 3 ways to configure NAT: 

### ****Static NAT****

In this, a single unregistered (Private) IP address is mapped with a legally registered (Public) IP address i.e one-to-one mapping between local and global addresses. This is generally used for Web hosting. These are not used in organizations as there are many devices that will need Internet access and to provide Internet access, a public IP address is needed. 

Suppose, if there are 3000 devices that need access to the Internet, the organization has to buy 3000 public addresses that will be very costly. 

### ****Dynamic NAT****

In this type of NAT, an unregistered IP address is translated into a registered (Public) IP address from a pool of public IP addresses. If the IP address of the pool is not free, then the packet will be dropped as only a fixed number of private IP addresses can be translated to public addresses. 

Suppose, if there is a pool of 2 public IP addresses then only 2 private IP addresses can be translated at a given time. If 3rd private IP address wants to access the Internet then the packet will be dropped therefore many private IP addresses are mapped to a pool of public IP addresses. NAT is used when the number of users who want to access the Internet is fixed. This is also very costly as the organization has to buy many global IP addresses to make a pool. 

### ****Port Address Translation (PAT)****

This is also known as NAT overload. In this, many local (private) [IP addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/) can be translated to a single registered IP address. Port numbers are used to distinguish the traffic i.e., which traffic belongs to which IP address. This is most frequently used as it is cost-effective as thousands of users can be connected to the Internet by using only one real global (public) IP address.

Zigbee is a wireless communication protocol designed for low-power, low-data-rate applications, primarily used in the Internet of Things (IoT) for connecting smart devices. It's built on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.
Here's a breakdown of what Zigbee is and how it works:
