üîÅ Step-by-Step Working of CSMA/CD:

1. Carrier Sense:

The device (node) listens to the medium (cable) to check if it's free (i.e., no other device is transmitting).



2. Multiple Access:

==Multiple devices can access the same channel, but only one can send data at a time.==



3. Transmit Data:

If the medium is idle, the device starts transmitting its data packet.



4. Collision Detection:

While transmitting, the device keeps listening to detect if another device transmitted at the same time, causing a collision.

A collision causes the signal to become distorted, which can be detected.



5. Jam Signal:

==If a collision is detected, the device immediately stops transmission and sends a jam signal to alert all other devices on the network that a collision occurred.==



6. Backoff Algorithm:

After sending the jam signal, the device ==waits for a random time== before trying again. This time is calculated using the Binary Exponential Backoff algorithm.

If another collision happens, the waiting time doubles, up to a limit.



7. Retry:

After the wait, the device senses the medium again and retries sending the data.

üîÅ Step-by-Step Working of CSMA/CA:

1. Carrier Sense (Listen First):

The device checks if the wireless medium (channel) is idle (no one is transmitting).



2. Wait If Busy:

If the channel is busy, the device waits until it becomes idle.



3. Random Backoff Time:

Even if the channel becomes idle, the device waits for a random backoff time to reduce the chance of two devices sending data at the same time.



4. Optional RTS/CTS (Request to Send / Clear to Send):

To further avoid collisions, the device may send a RTS (Request to Send) signal to the receiver.

The receiver replies with a CTS (Clear to Send) signal.

Other devices hearing RTS or CTS know to stay silent, reducing chances of collision.



5. Data Transmission:

After the backoff and/or CTS, the device transmits the data.



6. ACK (Acknowledgment):

The receiver sends an ACK to confirm successful data receipt.

If no ACK is received, the sender assumes a collision or error occurred and retries.
