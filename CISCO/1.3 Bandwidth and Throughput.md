Different physical media support the transfer of bits at different speeds. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">The rate of data transfer is usually discussed in terms of bandwidth and throughput</mark>.

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data</mark>.
Bandwidth is typically measured in the number of bits that (theoretically) can be sent across the media in a second. 

Common bandwidth measurements are as follows:

- Thousands of bits per second (Kbps)
- Millions of bits per second (Mbps)
- Billions of bits per second (Gbps)

The table shows the commonly used units of measure for bandwidth.

| Unit of Bandwidth   | Abbreviation | Equivalence                               |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Bits per second     | bps          | 1 bps = fundamental unit of bandwidth     |
| Kilobits per second | Kbps         | 1 Kbps = 1,000 bps = 103¬†bps              |
| Megabits per second | Mbps         | 1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bps = 106¬†bps          |
| Gigabits per second | Gbps         | 1 Gbps = 1,000,000,000 bps = 109¬†bps      |
| Terabits per second | Tbps         | 1 Tbps = 1,000,000,000,000 bps = 1012¬†bps |

## 1.3.2 Throughput

Factors influence throughput including:

- The amount of data being sent and received over the connection
- The types of data being transmitted
- The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Latency</mark> refers to the amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another.

Throughput measurements do not take into account the validity or usefulness of the bits being transmitted and received. Many messages received through the network are not destined for specific user applications. An example would be network control messages that regulate traffic and correct errors.

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">In an internetwork or network with multiple segments, throughput cannot be faster than the slowest link of the path from sending device to the receiving device. Even if all or most of the segments have high bandwidth, it will only take one segment in the path with lower bandwidth to create a slowdown of the throughput of the entire network.</mark>

## **Throughput VS Bandwidth**:

---

### üõ£Ô∏è **Bandwidth**

**Definition:**  
The **maximum capacity** of a network connection.  
It tells you **how much data** can theoretically be transferred per second.

- Think of it like the **width of a highway**‚Äîthe wider it is, the more cars (data) can travel at once.
    

**Unit:**  
Measured in **Mbps**, **Gbps**, etc. (Megabits/Gigabits per second)

**Example:**  
If your internet plan offers **100 Mbps bandwidth**, that's the maximum amount of data that can pass through your connection per second under ideal conditions.

---

### üöó **Throughput**

**Definition:**  
The **actual amount of data** successfully transmitted over the network in a given time.

- Like the **number of cars actually moving** on the highway at a certain time.
    

**Unit:**  
Also measured in **Mbps**, **Gbps**, etc.

**Example:**  
Even with 100 Mbps bandwidth, your **throughput might only be 60 Mbps** due to network congestion, interference, or hardware limitations.

### üîç **Key Difference:**

| Feature              | Bandwidth                      | Throughput                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| What it measures     | Maximum capacity               | Actual performance                               |
| Theoretical or Real? | Theoretical maximum            | Real-world result                                |
| Affected by?         | Fixed by your plan or hardware | Affected by latency, interference, traffic, etc. |
