The image shows the **Ethernet Frame Format** as defined by **IEEE 802.3**. Here's a breakdown of each field in detail:

---

### üîπ **1. Preamble (7 bytes)**

- **Purpose**: Used to synchronize the receiver's clock.
- **Content**: A repeating pattern of `10101010`.
- **Function**: ==Alerts the receiving device== to incoming data and allows it to lock onto the signal timing.

---

### üîπ **2. SFD ‚Äì Start Frame Delimiter (1 byte)**

- **Purpose**: Indicates the end of the preamble and the start of the actual frame.
- ==**Value**: Always `10101011`==.
- **Function**: Tells the receiving NIC (Network Interface Card) that the next byte will be the destination MAC address.

---

### üîπ **3. Destination MAC Address (6 bytes)**

- **Purpose**: Specifies the MAC address of the receiving device.
- **Function**: Ensures the frame is delivered to the correct recipient on the network.

---

### üîπ **4. Source MAC Address (6 bytes)**

- **Purpose**: Identifies the sender‚Äôs MAC address.
- **Function**: Allows the recipient to know where the frame came from.

---

### üîπ **5. VLAN Tag (Optional - 4 bytes)**

- **Purpose**: Used for VLAN (Virtual LAN) tagging as per ==IEEE 802.1Q.==
- **Function**: Adds priority and VLAN ID information to manage traffic efficiently in VLAN environments.

---

### üîπ **6. Type (2 bytes)**

- **Purpose**: Indicates the ==protocol type in the payload== (e.g., IPv4, ARP).
- **Function**: Helps the receiving device know how to process the payload data.
- - If ‚â§ 1500, it's a **length field** (used in older IEEE 802.3).
- - If ‚â• 1536 (0x0600), it's a **Type field** (used in Ethernet II).

---

### üîπ **7. Data / Payload (42 to 1500 bytes)**

- **Purpose**: Contains the actual data being transmitted.
- **Function**: Includes information like IP packets, ARP, etc.
- **Minimum size**:
    - ==46 bytes when **no VLAN tag**.==
    - ==42 bytes when **VLAN tag present** (since tag takes 4 bytes)==.
    - Padding is added if the data is smaller.

---

### üîπ **8. CRC / FCS ‚Äì Frame Check Sequence (4 bytes)**

==Cyclic Redundancy Check==

- **Purpose**: ==For error checking.==
- **Function**: Receiver calculates CRC to detect transmission errors.
- ==**If error is found**: Frame is dropped.==

---

### üìè **Total Frame Size: 64 ‚Äì 1522 Bytes**

- **Minimum**: ==64 bytes== (including all fields and padding if needed).
- **Maximum**: ==1518 bytes== (without VLAN) or **1522 bytes** (with VLAN).

---

| VLAN Tag (optional) | 4 bytes   | VLAN info and priority       |
| Type/Length         | 2 bytes   | Payload protocol or length   |
| Data (Payload)      | 42‚Äì1500 B | Actual transmitted data      |

Collisions occur in half-duplex mode, not in full-duplex.


---

‚úÖ Explanation:

üîπ Half-Duplex Mode:

Devices can either send or receive at a time, not both.

If two devices try to send data at the same time, a collision occurs.

This is common in older Ethernet networks using hubs.

CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) is used to detect and handle collisions.


üîπ Full-Duplex Mode:

Devices can send and receive simultaneously.

Each direction has a separate channel (no shared medium).

No collisions occur, so CSMA/CD is not used.

Used in modern switched Ethernet networks with switches.



---

üìå Summary Table:

Mode	Send & Receive Simultaneously?	Collisions Possible?	Protocol Used

Half-Duplex	‚ùå No	‚úÖ Yes	CSMA/CD
Full-Duplex	‚úÖ Yes	‚ùå No	No CSMA/CD needed

üîå Speed and Duplex Negotiation in Networking

Speed and duplex negotiation refers to how two connected devices (like a computer and a switch) decide how fast they will communicate and whether they will use full-duplex or half-duplex mode.


---

‚úÖ What is Negotiated?

1. Speed ‚Äì The data transfer rate:

Common speeds: 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps (and higher).



2. Duplex Mode:

Half-Duplex: Data flows in one direction at a time (like a walkie-talkie).

Full-Duplex: Data can flow in both directions simultaneously (like a phone call).





---

üîÑ Auto-Negotiation

Most modern network devices use ==auto-negotiation,== a feature defined in the ==IEEE 802.3u standard==.

It allows devices to automatically select the highest performance mode both support.

Negotiation happens via Fast Link Pulses (FLPs).


Example: If Device A supports:

10 Mbps (Half, Full)

100 Mbps (Half, Full)


And Device B supports:

100 Mbps (Full)


Then they will settle on 100 Mbps Full-Duplex.


---

‚ö†Ô∏è Mismatched Duplex ‚Äî A Common Issue

If auto-negotiation is disabled on one device and enabled on the other, it can cause:

Duplex mismatch: One end might think it‚Äôs full-duplex, the other half-duplex.

Result: Severe performance issues due to collisions and retransmissions.
