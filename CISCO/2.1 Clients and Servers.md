### **Hosts in a Network**

- **Hosts** are **computers connected to a network** that **participate directly** in network communication.

- They can both **send** and **receive** messages over the network.

- In modern networks, a host can function as:

    - A **client**
        
    - A **server**
        
    - Or **both** (simultaneously)
        
- The **role of the host** is determined by the **software installed** on the computer.

### **Servers and Clients in a Network**

#### **Servers:**

- **Servers are hosts** that have special software to **provide services** like email or web pages.
    
- Each service (email, web, file sharing, etc.) needs **separate server software**.
    
- Example: A host running **web server software** can provide websites to users.
    
- Servers are usually **connected to the global internet** to deliver information to users.
    

#### **Clients:**

- **Clients are hosts** with software that allows them to **request and display** information from servers.
    
- Example of client software: **Web browsers** like Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, or Chrome.

### **Types of Servers and Their Functions**

| **Type**  | **Description**                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Email** | The email server runs **email server software**.Clients use **mail client software** (e.g., Microsoft Outlook) to access email.           |
| **Web**   | The web server runs **web server software**.Clients use **browser software** (e.g., Internet Explorer) to view web pages.                 |
| **File**  | The file server **stores files** in a central location.Clients access these files with **client software** (e.g., Windows File Explorer). |

![[Pasted image 20250413121729.png]]



- **Client and server software** can run on the **same computer**.

- In **small businesses or homes**, many computers act as **both clients and servers**â€”this is called a **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network**.

### **Simple P2P Network**

- The **simplest P2P network** has just **two directly connected computers** (wired or wireless).
- Both computers can **exchange data and services**, acting as **client or server when needed**.

### **Larger P2P Networks**

- **Multiple PCs** can be connected using a **network device** (e.g., a **switch**) to form a **larger P2P network**.

### **Disadvantages of P2P Networks**

- A **host's performance can degrade** if it acts as **both a client and a server** simultaneously.
- Not suitable for **large-scale networks** due to **increased traffic and resource limitations**.

### **Larger Business Networks**

- In bigger organizations, **dedicated servers** are required to handle the **high volume of service requests** and ensure stable performance.

### **Advantages P2P**:

- Easy to set up
- Less complex
- ==Lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required==
- Can be ==used for simple tasks such as transferring files== and sharing printers

### **Disadvantages P2P:**

- No centralized administration
- Not as secure
- Not scalable
- All devices may act as both clients and servers which can slow their performance
