## **The Bit**

1. data is stored and transmitted as a series of bits

2. bit is an abbreviation of “binary digit” and represents the smallest piece of data

3. computers use binary codes to represent and interpret letters, numbers and special characters with bits. 

4. A commonly used code is the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). With ASCII, each character is represented by eight bits.

5. Each group of eight bits, such as the representations of letters and numbers, is known as a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">byte</mark>.

## **Common Methods of Data Transmission**

- After the data is transformed into a series of bits, it must be converted into signals that can be sent across the network media to its destination.
- Media refers to the physical medium eg:copper wire, fiber-optic cable, and electromagnetic waves

- **Electrical signals -**  electrical pulses on copper wire.
- **Optical signals -**  light pulses.
- **Wireless signals -**  infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">In most homes and small businesses, network signals are transmitted across copper wires (cables) or Wi-Fi enabled wireless connections. Larger networks employ fiber-optic cables in order to reliably carry signals for longer distances.</mark>
