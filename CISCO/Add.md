TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is one of the main protocols used in computer networks, especially the internet.

In simple words:

TCP is like a reliable delivery system for data. When two computers want to talk (like a phone and a server), TCP:

1. Breaks big data into small packets.


2. Sends them one by one.


3. Makes sure all packets reach safely.


4. Rearranges them in the right order.


5. Resends anything that gets lost.



Key Features:

Reliable: Guarantees delivery.

Ordered: Data arrives in the same order it was sent.

Error-checked: Fixes missing or wrong packets.


Used for:

Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)

Emails (SMTP)

File transfers (FTP)
