<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">what is a bash shell</mark>

### Scripts start with a bash bang.

Scripts are also identified with a¬†`shebang`. Shebang is a combination of¬†`bash #`¬†and¬†`bang !`¬†followed the the bash shell path. This is the first line of the script. Shebang tells the shell to execute it via bash shell. Shebang is simply an absolute path to the bash interpreter.

Below is an example of the shebang statement.

```bash
#! /bin/bash
```

how to get the path

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

```OUTPUT
/bin/bash
```

rewrite shelltest.sh as ==mycode==

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo helloworld
```

now to execute without bash like `./shelltest.sh`
!! WE SHOULD ALWAYS SPECIFY THE PATH AT THE TOP

now to sun the sh file

```bash
 ./shelltest.sh
```

```OUTPUT
bash: ./shelltest.sh: Permission denied
```

TO fix the permission denied issue  we need to give permission to the file permission to get executed

current permission for shelltest.sh
![[Pasted image 20250720092120.png]]

```
ls -l
```

the -l is a flag for showing the long format

to Provide ==execution rights to your user==.

Modify the file permissions and allow execution of the script by using the command below:

```bash
chmod u+x hello_world.sh
```

`chmod`¬†modifies the existing rights of a file for a particular user. ==We are adding¬†`+x`¬†to user¬†`u`.==

# Variables

![[Pasted image 20250720093257.png]]


```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo what is your first name ?
read first_name
echo what is your last name ?
read last_name

echo hello $first_name $last_name
```

inserting value into a variable 

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# A simple variable example
greeting=Hello
name=Tux
echo $greeting $name
```

possiton 0 is reserved for the shell itself

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo hello $1 $2
```

# piping

![[Pasted image 20250720095411.png]]

if the op of a command is very long and we need to filter it out
![[Pasted image 20250720114310.png]]

to filter this we use piping
![[Pasted image 20250720114547.png]]

to pipe 

![[Pasted image 20250720114625.png]]

so here we send the output from one command to anoter by using pipe symbol  <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> | </mark>

grep --> used to filter out words

# Output redirrection

`>` and `>>` 

used to send output from a command to a file

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">use cases</mark>

-  logging to a text flie using tmestamp
- dynamic creating
![[Pasted image 20250720115410.png]]
 ![[Pasted image 20250720124209.png]]

so this means helo file was over written
means `>` always ==overwrite== the exciting file
 `>>` is used to ==append== the data
 
![[Pasted image 20250720124431.png]]

### to get input form the text file 

`<` or `<<` or `<<<`

to get the word count
```
$ wc -w hello.txt
5 hello.txt
```

to get input from a text file to a command like `wc` command gets the file hello.txt
we can do it like 

```
$ wc -w < hello.txt
```

in this way we can redirect he file to wc command

```
$ wc -w < hello.txt
5
```

![[Pasted image 20250720150054.png]]

to pass a string to a command we use `<<<`

```
$ wc -w <<< "good morning bitches"
3
```

# Test operators

```
[ hello = hello ]
echo $?
0
```

there should be spacing between square bracket and hello
this is used to check weather hello =  hello
the result is printed as 0

`$?` --> shows the exit code of last executed command

```
[ 1 = 0 ]
echo $?
1
```

# if  / elif / else

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ ${1,,} = herbert ]; then
	echo "Oh, you're the boss here. Welcome!"
elif [ ${1,,} = help ]; then
	echo "Just enter your username, duh!"
else
	echo "I don't know who you are. But you're not the boss of me!"
fi
```

### **Line 2**

bash

CopyEdit

`if [ ${1,,} = herbert ]; then`

- `if`: Begins a conditional block.
    
- `${1}`: Refers to the **first argument** passed to the script.
    
- `${1,,}`: Converts the value to **lowercase** using Bash parameter expansion (this is useful if a user types "Herbert", "HERBERT", etc.).
    
- `[ ... = herbert ]`: Checks if the lowercase version of the input equals `"herbert"`.
    
- `then`: If the condition is true, run the block inside the `then`.
    

> ‚úÖ If the argument is "herbert" (case-insensitive), this block will exec

### **Line 8**


`fi`

- Ends the `if` statement block.

### üîç `${1,,}` ‚Äî What does it do exactly?

This expression is a form of **case conversion** in Bash.

#### Here's the breakdown:

- `${...}`: This is how you **access and manipulate variables** in Bash.
    
- `1`: Refers to the **first positional parameter**, i.e., the **first argument** passed to the script (when running `./script.sh akshay`, `$1` is `akshay`).
    
- `,,`: This is a **case modifier** ‚Äî it converts all **uppercase letters** in the string to **lowercase**.
    

---

### ‚úÖ Usage: Case-insensitive comparison

So, when you write:

```bash
${1,,}
```

It means:  
**Take whatever was passed as the first argument (`$1`) and convert it to all lowercase letters.**

---

### üîß Why use this?

Bash string comparisons are **case-sensitive** by default.  
That means:

```bash
if [ "$1" = "herbert" ]; then
```

...would **fail** if the user typed `Herbert`, `HERBERT`, etc.

But:

```bash
if [ ${1,,} = herbert ]; then
```

...**accepts any capitalization**, like:

- `Herbert`
    
- `HERBERT`
    
- `herbert`
    
- `hErBeRt`
    

Because it converts **everything to lowercase before comparison**.

---

### üß† Extra: Bash string case modifiers

You can use several case operations in Bash:

|Syntax|Result|
|---|---|
|`${var,,}`|All characters to **lowercase**|
|`${var^^}`|All characters to **UPPERCASE**|
|`${var,}`|Only **first** character to lowercase|
|`${var^}`|Only **first** character to UPPERCASE|

---

### üß™ Example in action:

Let's test it with a small Bash snippet:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Original input: $1"
echo "Lowercased input: ${1,,}"
```

Running:

```bash
$ ./test.sh HeRBeRT
Original input: HeRBeRT
Lowercased input: herbert
```

So now you can compare easily with `herbert` in your script.
