#  Kadane’s Algorithm problems


## ✅ **Easy Level**

These help you **understand and apply basic Kadane’s** approach.

1. 🔹 **[53. Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)**
    
    - Classic Kadane's problem.
        
    - Find the largest sum of any contiguous subarray.
        
2. 🔹 **[918. Maximum Sum Circular Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-circular-subarray/)**
    
    - Kadane’s + handle circular condition.
        
    - Requires finding both min and max subarray sums.
        
3. 🔹 **[121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)**
    
    - Transform to max subarray of profit changes.
        

---

## 🟡 **Medium Level**

These extend Kadane’s to slightly more complex situations.

1. 🔸 **[152. Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/)**
    
    - Need to track both max and min products (because negative × negative = positive).
        
2. 🔸 **[53. Maximum Subarray – Follow-up: Return Indices](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/solutions/20396)**
    
    - Modify Kadane’s to track the **start and end** indices of the subarray.
        
3. 🔸 **[713. Subarray Product Less Than K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-product-less-than-k/)**
    
    - Apply sliding window; similar approach to Kadane for products.
        
4. 🔸 **[560. Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)**
    
    - Uses prefix sums, but it's often confused with Kadane’s. A good variation.
        

---

## 🔴 **Hard Level**

These require **modifying or combining Kadane’s** with other techniques.

1. 🔻 **[174. Dungeon Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/dungeon-game/)**
    
    - 2D grid version, related to Kadane-style DP on 2D.
        
2. 🔻 **[363. Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-sum-of-rectangle-no-larger-than-k/)**
    
    - Extend Kadane to 2D and use binary search trees or prefix sum compression.
        
3. 🔻 **[42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)**
    
    - Not Kadane directly, but requires similar "scan" style logic.
        
4. 🔻 **[53. Maximum Subarray – Advanced Variant](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/solutions/20448)**
    
    - Return multiple such subarrays or count the number of maximum sum subarrays.

# <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Array Rotation</mark>

## 🔁 **Rotation & Circular Array Based Problems**

### ✅ 1. **[189. Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/)** — _You already did this!_

- Right rotate the array by `k` steps (in-place).
    

---

### ✅ 2. **[396. Rotate Function](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-function/)** – _Medium_

- You’re given a function:  
    `F(k) = 0 * A[k] + 1 * A[k+1] + ... + (n-1) * A[k+n-1]` (modulo indexing).
    
- Find the maximum value of F(k) for all rotations.
    

---

### ✅ 3. **[503. Next Greater Element II](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/)** – _Medium_

- You must treat the array as **circular**.
    
- For each element, find the next greater element (wrap around if needed).
    
- Stack + modulo index logic is key here.
    

---

### ✅ 4. **[918. Maximum Sum Circular Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-circular-subarray/)** – _Medium_

- Kadane’s Algorithm extended for **circular arrays**.
    
- Either max subarray is:
    
    - In the middle (normal Kadane), or
        
    - Wrapped around (total sum - min subarray)
        

---

### ✅ 5. **[622. Design Circular Queue](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-circular-queue/)** – _Medium_

- Implement a **circular queue** using an array with wrap-around logic.
    

---

### ✅ 6. **[641. Design Circular Deque](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-circular-deque/)** – _Medium_

- Extend circular queue logic to support insertion/deletion from both ends.
    

---

### ✅ 7. **[414. Third Maximum Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/third-maximum-number/)** – _Easy_

- Not rotation directly, but involves **array manipulation and index tracking** — helps reinforce slicing logic.
    

---

### ✅ 8. **[485. Max Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/)** – _Easy_

- Focuses on **subarray patterns**, important for sliding window + circular ideas.
    

---

## ✍️ Suggested Practice Order:

1. ✅ **189. Rotate Array**
    
2. ✅ **503. Next Greater Element II**
    
3. ✅ **918. Max Sum Circular Subarray**
    
4. ✅ **396. Rotate Function**
    
5. ✅ **622 & 641. Circular Queue / Deque**
